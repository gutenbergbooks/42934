<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chI'>CHAPTER I—THE PERFECTED PLANS</h1>

<p>“Well, now, that’s settled!” declared Polly
Brewster, as she leaned back in a comfortable
arm-chair and scanned her friend who sat hunched
over the papers scattered upon the table.
</p>

<p>“Settled—but only between us. It remains to
be seen how our suggestions will be received by
Dalky and Mrs. Courtney,” returned Eleanor
Maynard, the young lady just addressed.
</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, Nolla,” began Polly in a
lowered tone, “I’d much rather sail the seas with
Dalky, in his yacht, than venture in a rented craft
supervised by Mrs. Courtney—even though she
is the dearest thing I ever had for a chaperone!”
</p>

<p>Nolla was the nickname given Eleanor, and
Dalky was the pet name bestowed upon Mr. Dalken
by these two girls—his staunch admirers.
As yet they had not discovered an appropriate
title to use for their first customer and intimate
friend Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“Well, Nolla, seeing we’ve used up carloads of
good paper in outlining this itinerary, and worn
out the patience of all the clerks in the various
Tour Offices, let us act upon our last decision:
Propose the plans for our ocean picnic at the general
meeting of our friends to-night.”
</p>

<p>“It is such a radical change from the trip suggested
by Mrs. Courtney, and the outlined voyage
desired by Dalky, that I fear we’ll be vetoed in
the final ballot,” ventured Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“They can only say no to us!” exclaimed Polly,
getting up from her chair and gathering in all the
now useless sheets of paper which showed where
arduous ideas had been expressed upon their white
surfaces. But one sheet was left safely at the
end of the table. This single sheet was picked
up by Eleanor and carefully placed within her
script case. The discarded sheets were torn up
and thrown into the waste basket.
</p>

<p>“We may as well go home and try out the plans
on the Fabians,” said Polly, after rearranging the
desk-table.
</p>

<p>“And see that we look our best for the conquest
to-night,” laughed Eleanor, looking about for her
hat and coat.
</p>

<hr class='tb'/>

<p>Are you acquainted with Polly and Eleanor?
If not, you should be. They are the two friends
who were introduced to us several years ago at
Pebbly Pit Ranch. Remember? At our first
meeting with them these two girls were barely
past fourteen; but we founded a firm friendship
with them and their immediate companions, at the
great Colorado ranch, and this friendship has
lasted all through the interesting, and many times
thrilling, adventures these girls experienced. To
you, who have been denied this friendship, we will
introduce our girls.
</p>

<p>Polly Brewster, born and reared on her home
ranch in the Rockies of Colorado, first met and
established a friendship with Eleanor Maynard
of Chicago, when Eleanor, attended by her elder
sister Barbara and Anne Stewart, spent the summer
with the Brewsters at Pebbly Pit Ranch.
During that visit the girls, while on a mountain
ride, discovered the vein of gold which later developed
such amazing phases of interest and trouble
for all concerned in its products.
</p>

<p>The summer ending, the two young girls, now
firm friends, won the consent of their parents to
allow them to accompany Anne Stewart to New
York City, where Anne was engaged to teach a
very high-grade, young ladies’ school. Polly and
Eleanor planned to enter this school, and take up
interior decorating as an extra study.
</p>

<p>Having been admitted to a course at Cooper
Union Night Classes, the two girl friends found
Mr. Fabian, the lecturer, a most valuable friend.
Through Mr. Fabian the girls were enabled to attend
many private exhibitions of art goods and
antiques, also to go to lectures, visit gatherings
where interior decorating was the subject of discussion,
and in other ways reap the benefit of the
many years’ experience of this gentleman.
</p>

<p>During their school years in New York Polly
and Eleanor became acquainted with a staunch
friend, a Mr. Dalken; and met and became intimate
friends with the Ashbys—the Ashby of the
famous Ashby Shops on Fifth Avenue, where one
may find any rare or antique object known to
home-makers or decorators.
</p>

<p>Through the acquaintances thus formed the two
girls were invited to join the touring party about
to start for Europe the year that Polly and
Eleanor finished their schooling. After a summer
abroad visiting interesting places and seeing all
that was worth viewing, the group of Americans
returned home.
</p>

<p>That fall the two girls decided to enter business
in an humble way. They secured desk-room
in Mr. Ashby’s business house and ventured forth
to find and purchase antiques, in order to sell
them again at a reasonable profit. The amusing
incidents experienced while in search of odd and
old objects constitute several chapters of the book
called “Polly’s Business Venture.” At the ending
of that book the reader is introduced to Mrs.
Courtney, who interested herself in the two young
business girls and eventually invited them to accompany
her on a cruise to the Southern Seas.
Before any plan could be perfected, however, Mr.
Dalken hinted at his plan to go on an extended
yachting cruise to the Orient. Naturally, he
wished a party of his old friends to accompany
him; and Polly and Eleanor considered themselves
part of that group.
</p>

<p>Thus it happened that about the time the present
story opens Polly and Eleanor had been planning
various itineraries to place before their
friends—Mr. Dalken and Mrs. Courtney. It
mattered not so much to the girls whether they
sailed to the Orient as the guests of Mr. Dalken,
or went on a long cruise to the South Sea Islands
with Mrs. Courtney, as long as they <span class='it'>went</span> somewhere!
From this state of mind the reader can
gather that the Wanderlust had implanted its
germ in the consciousness of each of these girls.
</p>

<p>Having gathered their papers together the girls
left the pretty private office where they were supposed
to attend to their business affairs, and started
homeward to the Fabian’s domicile where they
lived. It was too late, upon their arrival at the
house, to discuss the tour with either Mr. or Mrs.
Fabian, hence they went directly to their rooms
and dressed as becomingly as possible, knowing,
as they well did, that appearances play an important
part in any business, be it pleasure, financial,
political or just simple family matters.
</p>

<p>Just as Polly had added a huge velvet rose to
the girdle of the Parisian dress she had chosen to
wear, Nancy Fabian called from the hallway:
</p>

<p>“Girls! Are you almost ready? Daddy has
been cooling his impatience in the library for the
last ten minutes; and mother and I are ready to
go down.”
</p>

<p>“Coming, Nan!” called Polly in answer.
“Find out if Nolla is ready, please.”
</p>

<p>“I’m here—no need to call me,” laughed Eleanor,
coming from her room as she spoke.
</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Nancy Fabian. “Why
all the fine feathers on our bird, Nolla?”
</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian and Nancy looked at Eleanor’s
handsome dinner dress with admiration, and
Eleanor laughed as she replied to Nancy’s query:
</p>

<p>“As long as this bird has no wish to be plucked
at the argument that is certain to be started on
the subject of the sea-trip, she donned her finest
feathers to help her win out with Dalky.”
</p>

<p>At this moment Polly appeared at her room
door. She, too, caused Nancy to catch her breath.
“Goodness me! I didn’t stop to floss up as if we
were going to a Court Reception! Why didn’t
you girls tell me you were going to put on your
best?”
</p>

<p>“Nancy, dear, don’t worry,” was Polly’s consoling
reply. “You haven’t the diplomatic work
cut out for yourself that Nolla and I have. We
have to win Dalky over to a very important agreement
to-night, hence these fine togs!”
</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian had been descending the stairs,
but she heard what had just been said and she
laughed lightly. Soon all four had reached the
front hall where Mr. Fabian paced the floor.
</p>

<p>“My dear girls! You know how I dislike being
late to a host’s dinner party! Here it is ten
minutes past the time we were to present ourselves
at Dalky’s apartment.” As he spoke Mr.
Fabian took his watch from his pocket and displayed
its face to the tardy young ladies. But they
never stopped to glance at it.
</p>

<p>“Daddy, dear, stop scolding, and hurry out to
the car,” said Nancy, giving her father a loving
push towards the front door.
</p>

<p>“There’s one consolation in knowing we won’t
be the last guests at Dalky’s dinner to-night,”
remarked Eleanor, as they settled themselves in
the limousine which Mr. Dalken had sent for their
use that evening.
</p>

<p>“Why—what do you mean?” asked Mrs. Fabian,
wonderingly.
</p>

<p>“Mrs. Courtney! She’ll be ten minutes later
than this unit,” replied Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” asked Nancy.
</p>

<p>“Just before we left the office she called us
on the telephone to ask if we had decided upon
a plan for our cruise, and we replied that we had
it all outlined. Then she told us she might be
detained downtown where she was then, and that
we were to tell Mr. Dalken not to wait dinner
for her. She would come in as soon as she could,
but even at that she might be half an hour after
the time he mentioned in his note to her.”
</p>

<p>As Mr. Dalken’s bachelor apartment was but
a short drive from the Fabian’s residence, the
chauffeur soon stopped before the door and the
girls prepared to get out. A few minutes later
they were being welcomed by their smiling host.
Then he scolded.
</p>

<p>“Late as usual! Not that I would include Mr.
Fabian in that rebuke, because a man is <span class='it'>never</span>
late—especially when it is a dinner. But the
ladies! Ah me! So many valuable hours wasted
before a mirror, and who for—tell me that! For
a number of old fogies like Ashby, Fabian and
myself.”
</p>

<p>But the ladies laughed his scolding to silence.
They knew their host! He was the pink of neatness
himself, and he always noticed the gowns and
general appearances of his lady guests.
</p>

<p>“Who’s coming to-night, Dalky?” asked Polly,
not waiting to answer his rebuke about being late.
</p>

<p>“Oh, the Ashbys are already here; then there
will be Mrs. Courtney, who will be late, of course,
and my daughter Elizabeth. She ought to have
been here before this.”
</p>

<p>As he spoke he threw open the door of the
guestroom and ushered his friends in; but taking
Mr. Fabian by the arm to show him into his own
suite of rooms.
</p>

<p>As soon as the door of the guestroom was closed
Polly glanced at her three companions who were
silently exchanging looks with each other. Then
Eleanor whispered her opinion:
</p>

<p>“Elizabeth! Of all the world she is the last I
should have expected here to-night. I just know
her mother sent her to pry into Dalky’s plans for
this cruise. Naturally, such a woman would have
heard about her ex-husband’s plans for the next
few months.”
</p>

<p>Polly frowned at this declaration, but Mrs.
Fabian, always anxious to give a person the benefit
of a doubt, remarked kindly: “We must remember
that Elizabeth is her father’s only child. Perhaps
she is dining here this evening by accident—not
by planning.”
</p>

<p>But Eleanor flared up in defence of her friend
Dalky. “If you knew that girl as well as Polly
and I understand her from school days, you’d
not take this generous view of her and her mother’s
schemes. I only hope Dalky hasn’t any idea
of inviting her to go with us on his yachting cruise.
She’d just spoil all the fun for me!”
</p>

<p>“With Elizabeth present at the table I’d feel
embarrassed in speaking of our plan, Nolla; or of
saying a word about any cruise,” added Polly,
seriously.
</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s just it: Elizabeth is a kill-joy for
every one wherever she goes,” was Eleanor’s
angry retort.
</p>

<p>“Well, girls, let us not excite ourselves before
we know why Elizabeth is present to-night.
Plenty of time to talk over her lack of amiability
when we discover she will be a member of Dalky’s
party,” advised Mrs. Fabian, moving towards the
door of the dressing room.
</p>

<p>As she opened it the four friends who were
ready to leave fell back because the object of their
criticism stood upon the threshold.
</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried the girl with a pretty pretence
of feeling surprise, as she quickly placed her
hands over her heart. “I was told to leave my
wraps in Daddy’s guestroom, but I was not aware
that it was occupied. I’m sorry if I startled you
as I have been.”
</p>

<p>Elizabeth Dalken was the fashionable product
of New York’s ultra society—at least she and her
mother liked to believe they were embraced upon
that clannish upper-plane. But it is doubtful if
one of the Four Hundred even dreamed of there
being such aspirants to recognition.
</p>

<p>The girl was very pretty, in an appealing ingenue
way, her type being of the clinging order.
Her features were regular enough, but lacked all
signs of confidence or character. Her hair was
beautiful, being of the wavy, fluffy, gold shade of
blonde. Were it not for her stylish apparel, and
the lines produced by the highest-priced tailor and
mantua-maker in the country, Elizabeth’s figure
might have been termed awkward, and her natural
carriage ungainly. But style hides a multitude
of short-comings!
</p>

<p>The Fabians, as well as Polly and Eleanor,
were acquainted with Elizabeth Dalken, so, after
a few words of greeting, they left the room to
the new guest. Needless to add that Elizabeth
found it necessary to remain in the room for
four times the length of time the other four
guests had occupied it. But they had not felt
the need of touching up their lips, or relining their
brows with a pencil, nor, indeed, to add a rosy
hue to their healthy complexions. Elizabeth was
about to send a last glance at the long mirror to
see that her gown was faultless, when the bell
summoned Mr. Dalken to his entrance door.
This time the new comer called forth a chorus of
merry welcomes from the group of guests in the
living room, the archway of which offered a good
view of the front door and the reception hall.
</p>

<p>“Welcome, Mrs. Courtney! Glad you found
it possible to get here before dinner is announced,”
said Mr. Dalken, smiling upon his guest.
</p>

<p>“Oh! I am glad, too! I thought you would
be through the first course, as it is really half an
hour past the time you said,” remarked Mrs.
Courtney, releasing her small gloved hand from
the unconscious hold of her host’s warm clasp.
He had been appraising her beauty and appearance
and forgot he held her hand.
</p>

<p>“Come to the guestroom, Mrs. Courtney.
My little girl Elizabeth is still there, and she will
be delighted to meet you and render any little
service you may need. You see, a confirmed
bachelor as I am, fails to provide a maid or other
necessities for ladies when they deign to dine at
his rooms.” As he spoke, Mr. Dalken ushered
Mrs. Courtney to the guestroom door. Then he
paused and knocked upon the panel.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth threw the door open, appearing as a
radiant vision to her father, who said: “Ah,
Tots! Here is a friend of mine. In the absence
of a maid, I know you will be happy to assist in
any way. Mrs. Courtney, my daughter Elizabeth;
Totty, Mrs. Courtney.”
</p>

<p>Without waiting to see if this meeting proved
to be harmonious, Mr. Dalken closed the door
upon Mrs. Courtney, and hurried to his valet-cook
to say that the last guest expected had just arrived.
Karl nodded his head silently, and proceeded
to instruct the Japanese servant to turn up
the lights in the diningroom.
</p>

<p>At the closing of the guestroom door Elizabeth
turned and purred sweetly upon the lady to whom
she had just been introduced. She seemed over-eager
to assist in removing the handsome evening
wrap, and she stood hovering near while Mrs.
Courtney stood before the dressing mirror to arrange
her crushed hair. The girl babbled of
many things, but with all her babbling she never
lost sight of one detail of the lady’s costume and
make-up, and of the possible valuation of the
magnificent diamonds and pearls which adorned
her person. The jewelry caused pangs of envy
in Elizabeth’s soul, for she was mad over jewels.
</p>

<p>Out in the living-room, the waiting guests
amused themselves.
</p>

<p>“Before we prepare any further arguments to
win our case before the tribunal of the higher authorities,
we’d better sit back and watch whether
this will be a proper evening to throw the bomb,”
remarked Polly, dryly, to her chum Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“But this is the reason we are all assembled at
dinner to-night!” exclaimed Eleanor, impatiently.
“Dalky wants to get away from New York without
further delay, you know.”
</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know! Only do be circumspect,
Nolla, in the presence of Elizabeth. We know
her, and we do not know what she might say or do
to make trouble for our dear Dalky, if she once
finds that he plans to take us all on a long cruise.”
</p>

<p>“She can’t say or make any trouble for him,
that I can see!” retorted Eleanor. “That
woman got her divorce, all right, and is married
hard and fast to that awful suitor, so what other
trouble can be started after that?”
</p>

<p>Polly did not reply, but she shook her head
sympathetically. The sympathy, Eleanor understood,
was all for “Poor Dalky!”
</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney and Elizabeth now came from
the guest-room, Elizabeth smiling sweetly, and
Mrs. Courtney with her well-set head held a trifle
higher than was her wont, and with two bright
spots of crimson touching her cheeks with the hue
of restrained blood which must be dancing in her
veins. Her eyes, when she looked at Polly, were
shooting sparks, but these soon disappeared after
she shook hands with her friends who were glad
to see her.
</p>

<p>“See that!” whispered Eleanor quickly to
Polly. “That sweet little wasp has stung Mrs.
Courtney with something she has said, or hinted
at!”
</p>

<p>“So it seems. I wish I knew what to do,”
mused Polly.
</p>

<p>“Just wait and keep your eyes and ears wide
open. We’ll catch Elizabeth in any little plot
she or her mother may have planned,” declared
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>At this moment the Japanese attendant came to
the door and announced dinner. The friendly
party, being so informal, grouped itself about Mr.
Dalken and all moved slowly towards the dining-room—all
but Elizabeth Dalken. While all her
companions walked from the living-room to the
diningroom, listening to her father’s account of a
wonderful catch of fish in the Maine streams, she
had managed to get away unseen and enter the
guestroom. Behind the closed door of the room
she found what she had planned to secure.
Information.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken designated their seats to his
friends, and turning to Mrs. Courtney said, politely:
“As you are a guest in my home for the
first time I have assigned the seat of honor to
you—at my right. Of course, I had to beg permission
of Polly and Nolla before daring to trespass
upon their rights,—they generally fight for
this place.”
</p>

<p>Polly smiled and tossed her head, but Eleanor
vehemently denied any such weakness, while the
adults in the party laughed at their host’s teasing
ways. Mr. Dalken, meantime, had been searching
for his daughter Elizabeth. She was not to
be seen.
</p>

<p>“Why! This is strange; did not Elizabeth
come to the diningroom just now?” asked he in
amazement of his guests.
</p>

<p>The guests looked from one to another in surprise.
They all believed the girl to have been
present with them. Before Mr. Dalken had time
to send the servant to find the missing daughter,
however, she ran from the dressingroom and hurried
to the diningroom.
</p>

<p>“Pardon my absence, Daddy,” was her call before
he had time to ask what was wrong. “I just
<span class='it'>had</span> to dab my nose a bit, you know.” She
laughed lightly as though it would be understood
how important a deed was the powdering of a
nose.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken patted the fluffy yellow head as
Elizabeth slid into her chair. Then the servant
was signalled to serve. Polly prodded Eleanor,
who sat next her at the table, with her foot under
cover of the long damask cloth. And Eleanor
glanced at her friend to see what she meant to
convey to her.
</p>

<p>In a very low voice Polly said: “Don’t you say
a word, hear me, Nolla? Wait till we know what
Elizabeth wants to know.”
</p>

<p>Eleanor winked knowingly. At the same time
Mr. Dalken tossed the conversational ball into the
arena for all to catch.
</p>

<p>“Friends and fellow-countrymen,” began he,
clearing his throat impressively, “we are assembled
together this evening in order that the important
event of taking a trip around the world
may be duly discussed. After the arguments for
and against the cruise in my yacht are heard, the
chairman—that is myself—will allow two minutes
to the argument for or against the acceptance of
Mrs. Courtney’s offer to sail to the South Seas
in her craft. The meeting is now open for all
members of this party.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken then rubbed his hands vigorously
as if to say he was washing them of all trouble
henceforth. If the members in the party came to
blows over their debate it would be nothing to
him! His guests, understanding his action,
laughed at him and bade him sit down.
</p>

<p>“At least, Mr. Chairman, you might tell us the
names of the speakers we are supposed to hear
from this evening,” laughed Mr. Fabian.
</p>

<p>“The first speaker to be heard from this evening,
is our capable globe-trotter Mr. Fabian,”
retorted Mr. Dalken without hesitation. A laugh
greeted this introduction, but the servant was
placing the first course before the hungry guests
and it was silently agreed to give the first attention
to the most important matter of food.
</p>

<p>During the next three courses there were many
suggestions, and merry arguments from the
friends about that board, but Elizabeth Dalken,
never missing a word or look of those who were
concerned in the cruise planned, kept silence. She
felt that she could work better and safer by getting
the viewpoints of others and not showing
her cards.
</p>

<p>With the fourth course, however, Mr. Dalken
seemed to feel certain of his own cruise being the
accepted one. He turned to gloat politely over
Mrs. Courtney’s defeat, when Mr. Ashby spoke.
</p>

<p>“The only reason I feel inclined to vote for the
Orient in Dalken’s yacht, is a selfish one: I would
like immensely to be one of the party on this
merry voyage, but I would not dare go on board
a yacht that is destined for the South Seas. I
would have no jumping-off place, in order to get
me back to New York for the busy season. Now,
should you all choose Dalky’s plan to go to Japan,
I can remain with you until we reach Hawaii,
there I can catch a fast steamship back to San
Francisco, thence speed home to New York.
Them’s my sentiments, fren’s!” concluded Mr.
Ashby.
</p>

<p>By the time the salad was served every one but
Polly, Eleanor and Elizabeth had been drawn into
the discussion. It took great self-control for the
two girl-partners to keep silence in this vital and
interesting debate.
</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Dalken turned to Eleanor and
said: “In all my experience, this is the first time
I have not heard Nolla have a say after every
other orator. Either she has nothing <span class='it'>to</span> say, or
she is waiting to drop a bomb upon our heads
when we have said all we know.”
</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed. “That’s just it! When you
all are through I’ll say my little piece, and I’m
sure it will take away your breath.”
</p>

<p>The friends laughed, for they understood
Eleanor and liked to urge her to discuss her egotistical
opinions—often they were well worth
hearing, too. Polly could not help sending Elizabeth
a glance. The girl kept her eyes fixed upon
her plate, defying Polly’s scrutiny.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken held up a hand as he commanded:
“Silence in this Court. Our wise Judge will now
render an opinion!”
</p>

<p>Eleanor instantly took up his line of chaff,
and, midst the laughter, bowing politely, said in a
dignified manner: “I thank you, Mr. Sheriff. As
the Honorable Judge of this trial at Court I wish
to give my opinion, and possibly a verdict. Has
the prisoner at the bar anything more to say in
behalf of her plan to sail the South Seas?”
</p>

<p>A condescending bow to Mrs. Courtney told
those at the table that she must be the prisoner
who committed the crime of planning an impossible
voyage. Mrs. Courtney smiled and shook
her head to signify she had had her say.
</p>

<p>“Ahem!” began Eleanor; then remembering
that Polly had the papers upon which they had
outlined the cruise as they wished to have it, she
turned and bowed in her direction. “Will the
Counsel for the State kindly read the evidence in
the case under argument?”
</p>

<p>Polly laughed, but Mr. Dalken said: “What a
pity I missed having such a wise judge at court in
the days when I tried my cases. I am sure I
might have won every case I argued.”
</p>

<p>This brought forth a general laugh at Eleanor’s
expense but little cared she, because she had
an axe to grind and such an insignificant matter
as a laugh cost her nothing.
</p>

<p>Polly now opened the typewritten page she had
taken from the girdle of her gown and glanced
at the opening words. Then she explained:
“This is a plan worked out by Nolla and myself.
Before I mention the very good reasons for
choosing this plan, I wish to outline the plan itself.
Then Nolla will say why we selected this cruise,
and tell you the points in favor of choosing it.”
</p>

<p>Polly now read: “We decide upon Dalky’s
yacht, because it is cheaper than leasing a craft;
it is more luxurious than any hired boat could ever
be; it is claimed to be absolutely safe to sail the
most dangerous seas; and, best of all, Dalky is
our sworn ally and gives Nolla and me our own
way in almost everything. That’s that!”
</p>

<p>The reasons for taking Mr. Dalken’s yacht
caused a hearty laugh at his expense; but Polly
continued reading without a pause, and the laugh
was hushed soon in order that the audience might
not lose one word of her plans.
</p>

<p>“We agree with Dalky in choosing a voyage
which will take us to the West Indies where we
can visit many interesting points generally visited
by other tourists; we also agree with him that a
trip through the Panama Canal will be not only
most instructive to us all but it will also prove to
be a short cut for my plan of the continued cruise.
Thus far,—that is until we reach the Pacific
Ocean—we have agreed to follow Dalky’s outline
of the trip.
</p>

<p>“But once having reached the Pacific, we begin
to see a fascination in sailing south—not to the
Cannibal Islands, but southward as far as Peru.
To those who have never visited Peru it might
be told, that here is a sight worth seeing: the
famous land that gave birth to the tubers known
to us as potatoes; also the land of the Incas.”
</p>

<p>Polly interrupted herself at this point to say:
“Friends, you may <span class='it'>think</span> I copied all this from the
travelogue issued by the South American Steamship
Line, but I assure you I did <span class='it'>not</span>! The circular
given the public by that steamship company never
mentions the fact that Peru was the motherland
that first produced the potato to the world at the
time when Pizarro found himself ship-wrecked
upon its shores. Hence this is original information
discovered by Nolla and myself at the time
of the War Famine of potatoes in this country.”
Then Polly turned her attention to the reading of
the paper.
</p>

<p>“Well, having visited all the novel places to be
seen in Peru, and having eaten our fill of Peruvian
Bark, we resume our cruise and next stop at
Valparaiso. At this point Dalky orders his Captain
to take the yacht around Cape Horn, then
northwards to Buenos Aires, where he might dock
and wait for us to join him. We will take the
Trans-Andean trip across the continental divide
and thus reach Argentina. As an inducement to
Dalky to agree with us to take this trip, we can
offer him many fine investments at Buenos
Aires—investments which promise the financier a return
of a thousand per cent in six months’ time.
It’s so, because I read it in a column of a South
American newspaper!”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken was well known to be a daring
gambler in the stock market, hence this thrust
caused his guests to laugh heartily at his weakness.
But Elizabeth frowned at what she termed insolence
on the part of Polly.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken now interpolated: “From Buenos
Aires we will sail to Rio de Janeiro, and remain
there to visit the great Fair. Having spent five
years’ allowance in seeing the buildings and going
to all the bazaars at the Fair, we return to
the yacht too bankrupt to tip the natives who
crowd about us for pennies.”
</p>

<p>“No, no, Dalky! There you are wrong. With
Nolla and me to act as bankers there will be no
danger of bankruptcy,” laughed Polly.
</p>

<p>“All right then! As long as you agree to keep
us out of bankruptcy in order that we may safely
return to New York,” retorted Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“What was your next point of interest on the
route?”
</p>

<p>“Well, after doing the Fair we decided to coast
along the shores of Brazil and eventually touch
at Guiana, then continue to the Barbados.
Thence back to little old New York!”
</p>

<p>The guests, and Mr. Dalken as well, listened
with intense interest to such a cruise, and finally,
having discussed the plan from every point of
view, it was unanimously agreed that such a voyage
would offer the most interesting sights, and
prove to be admirable in every other way. Those
who wished to remain on the yacht for a short
time only, could leave the tourists at Havana,
Panama, or any other port where steamships are
constantly sailing to New York. Those who
found it impossible to leave New York as soon as
the party wished to sail, could reach Havana or
Panama by rail and board the yacht at the time
it touched at those ports. Thus it was decided
that Polly and Eleanor’s plan had been the best
yet offered.
</p>

<p>The evening had been well spent, thought Polly
and Eleanor, when it was all but agreed upon that
the South American cruise should be the one
chosen for the Dalken party. But Elizabeth
Dalken had kept absolutely silent during the discussion
of the trip. Finally, her father turned and
smiled upon her, and said: “Well, little girl! Do
you thrill at such a wonderful voyage?”
</p>

<p>Elizabeth shrugged her shoulders in the French
way she had acquired from her mother, and remarked
in a colorless tone: “It will prove to be
such a bore at the Fair in Rio—this mixing with
common people from all over the world! I hear
the railroads and the majority of southern steamship
lines are offering cheap excursions there and
back to induce trades-people to take the trip. I
would rather take a trip to Japan and leave
South America to such a time as the common folk
need not be met.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken flushed painfully. He was a genuine
democrat in everything but politics, hence this
attitude of his daughter’s, an attitude fostered by
her society mother, hurt his feelings. However,
the friends gathered with him that evening, understood
perfectly why Elizabeth rendered such
poor judgment, and they quickly consoled their
host for the humiliation he had endured.
</p>

<p>“Dalky, it is your privilege to decide as you
please for this cruise. As invited guests we accept,
without a word of condemnation or
dissatisfaction, whatever you do. We firmly believe
that your society and the wonderful offer of taking
us with you on the cruise, no matter where it
be, will reward us for any personal or selfish desire
to sail elsewhere.” Thus said Mr. Ashby,
the best and closest friend of Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian added instantly: “And the association
with such a man as we know you to be, Dalken,
will soon wear away any sense of being
thrown with common folk, even though we meet
a few samples of ordinary tradesmen while in
Rio de Janeiro. We have to suffer them in New
York, more than at any other place in the world,
you know. I doubt if they will cause us to regret
this cruise.” As Mr. Fabian included Elizabeth
in this speech to her father, it was manifest to all
present that it was meant for a mild rebuke to
her arrogance.
</p>

<p>“Well, we will mull over the plan and render our
verdict at an early day,” remarked Mr. Dalken,
hoping to placate his daughter and win her
approval for the cruise, but Elizabeth refused
to be pleased, and announced with impatience: “I
must be going home, now, Daddy. I promised
Mother that I’d leave here before ten.”
</p>

<p>Without another word, she crossed the living
room and hurried to the guest-room for her
wraps. Her father followed with an uncertain
mien. Polly instantly jumped up and followed
after Elizabeth. As she passed the host she remarked:
“I’ll attend to Elizabeth, Dalky.”
</p>

<p>But the girl refused to accept any attention
from Polly, and soon after she had donned her
hat and wrap she came forth and said good-night
to the assembled guests. Mr. Dalken accompanied
her to the elevator, mildly persuading her
to change her mind. The lift arrived at the door,
and Elizabeth pecked at her father’s chin, then
left as if she had never heard one word of his
persuasion.
</p>

<p>Eleanor leaned close to Polly’s ear and murmured:
“From all forecasts from the weather bureau,
I should judge that we are in for nasty
weather on this cruise; I am surprised that Dalky
could be so short-sighted as this.”
</p>

<p>And Polly replied in the same subdued tone:
“It looks most suspicious to me, Nolla. Perhaps
that mother of Elizabeth’s heard of a certain
handsome woman whom I might mention, and
fears, should Dalky marry again, that Elizabeth
might not get her father’s fortune. You know
how tender hearted is Dalky where anything
concerns his daughter. If she asked him to take her
to the North Pole he would try and obey her
wish.”
</p>

<p>“Then you believe that she got Dalky to invite
her on this cruise?” wondered Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“From all I heard and saw to-night, I certainly
do! I think Dalky was pleased that she wished
to go with him, and agreed instantly without stopping
to think how such an addition might give the
entire party the odd member who opposes whatever
is suggested for the mutual enjoyment of
all.”
</p>

<p>“I believe you are right, Polly,” said Eleanor.
“And if it turns out that Elizabeth Dalken becomes
a member of our cruising party, it will behoove
us to protect Mrs. Courtney from her
thrusts, and spare her as many bites from the
sharp tongue which we know Elizabeth wags as
is possible for us to do.”
</p>

<p>With Elizabeth gone the others in the group
gathered at Mr. Dalken’s apartment felt freer to
talk over plans and propositions for the yachting
trip the host so magnanimously offered. Before
they said good-night and departed from Mr. Dalken’s
that evening, it was agreed to try out the
plan presented by Polly and Eleanor. Should
they find it disagreeable, by the time they reached
Panama, they could continue the cruise to Japan
from that point.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chII'>CHAPTER II—“THEY’RE OFF!”</h1>

<p>The result of that evening’s discussion at Mr.
Dalken’s apartment was soon revealed to those
interested in the cruise. After certain sundry
meetings at different places such as Ashby’s Shop
where the friends grouped in Polly’s office, at Fabian’s
dinner table, and at Mrs. Ashby’s home of
an evening, it was decided that the trip outlined
by Polly and Eleanor at Mr. Dalken’s dinner
party was the most alluring of any. Hence it was
agreed to follow their plan.
</p>

<p>Once it was decided to cruise to South America
the next question to decide was when to start.
Unanimously it was agreed to start the following
week. The yacht needed no overhauling as it
was always kept in perfect order to sail at a few
hours’ notice. Mr. Dalken seemed anxious to get
away from the City, saying his doctor ordered
him to go without delay, and the girls were more
than anxious to get away.
</p>

<p>The days following the sudden decision to start
in a week’s time, were filled with hurrying, scurrying
females of the party, especially Elizabeth Dalken.
She shopped as if she expected to visit an
Emperor and attend Court instead of going on
board her father’s private Yacht for a pleasure
trip to South America.
</p>

<p>Everybody felt it necessary to advise everybody
else about what to take and what not to take. It
seemed to Polly that the days fairly <span class='it'>crept</span> by, instead
of galloping past as they had been wont to
do in the last three years. But everything comes
to an end—even long, tedious waiting for a certain
day to arrive. And then the day came—a
day of unusual sunshine and balmy breezes: a perfect
day for a sea voyage to begin.
</p>

<p>To the two eager girls who waved last goodbys
to the maids at the Fabian home it seemed that
there never had been such a crowded week of
work as the one just finished. As the auto started
to the Yacht Club wharf, even Mr. Fabian, usually
so peaceful and quiet, sighed as if he, too, felt
thankful that the rush and confusion was over.
</p>

<p>“Goodness me! Look at the crowd waiting on
the dock to see us off!” cried Polly, looking from
the window of the car.
</p>

<p>Eleanor looked and exclaimed at the unexpected
number of groups, whereas it had been expected
that only a few of the young men would be
present to bid the girls goodby. Mr. and Mrs.
Ashby and Ruth, Mrs. Courtney and Elizabeth
Dalken expected to be on board the yacht; and
Eleanor Maynard’s father from Chicago had
wired that he would wait at Jacksonville, Florida,
for them to pick him up, as he had found it impossible
to leave his banking affairs in time to
start with them from New York. Polly’s father
and mother were at Pebbly Pit and they wired
their regrets that they could not join the merry
mariners, but John and Anne expected to arrive
in New York in time to say goodby to the party.
Then where could these many people have come
from? It was soon explained.
</p>

<p>As the Fabian car came up close to the Dalken
yacht, Mr. Fabian leaned out of the open window
to try and see if he recognized the number
of friends who had come to wish them <span class='it'>bon voyage.</span>
When he drew back into the automobile he
was smiling. The girls had no time to ask him
the cause of his amusement, because the chauffeur
stopped the car and immediately, a number of
handsome young men crowded close to the door
and began showering questions upon the youthful
occupants.
</p>

<p>Then Polly got out and looked around, fully expecting
to find her father and mother waiting to
surprise her at her sailing away for the adventure
to Southern Seas. But the girls were doomed to
a fall in their vanity—thinking all these persons
on the dock were assembled to bid them goodby!
To their chagrin they saw that the majority of
merry-makers were there to see another family
of friends off! not one of them had the slightest
acquaintance with Mr. Dalken’s party.
</p>

<p>In the group eagerly waiting for the last arrivals—the
unit composed of Mr. and Mrs. Fabian
and Nancy, Polly and Eleanor,—were to be
seen our old friends Mr. and Mrs. Latimer and
Tom. Tom had come all the way from the mine
at Pebbly Pit in order to see Polly, and hold her
hand just once before having her go so far away.
There, too, were Dr. and Mrs. Evans and Kenneth;
John Baxter and Mrs. Courtney. Evidently
the owner of the yacht and his daughter
Elizabeth were already on board, as a shout, to
attract Polly’s attention to the beautiful craft,
came from a number of young persons who were
talking in the prow of the yacht.
</p>

<p>“Look, Nolla! Isn’t that Paul Stewart and
Pete Maynard up there with Elizabeth Dalken?”
whispered Polly hurriedly, as she tried to see who
were the individual members in the group.
</p>

<p>“Well! If that doesn’t beat all! Come on,
Poll—let’s run in and shake hands. I haven’t
had a word with Paul for so long that my tongue
cleaves to the roof of my mouth.” And Eleanor
ran.
</p>

<p>Polly was forcibly detained at the moment she
started to follow Eleanor. Tom Latimer had
caught hold of her coat sleeve and was saying:
“Aren’t you going to wait here to see John and
Anne when they arrive?”
</p>

<p>“Oh! Aren’t we all going on board? Why
not visit with John and Anne, and all the rest of
you, while on the yacht?” asked Polly.
</p>

<p>Tom always became humble when in Polly’s
presence, and this occasion was no exception to
the rule. He meekly followed at Polly’s heels as
she led the way up the steps of the wharf to the
gangplank. In another moment Polly was surrounded
by her young friends and dragged to the
luxurious lounging room on the deck, where
wicker chairs and tables and divans invited one to
sit and enjoy life.
</p>

<p>A few moments after seating herself in one of
the wide-armed chairs—chosen in order to compel
Tom to select another chair and not try to
squeeze close to her side as he would have done
had she seated herself on the divan—Polly saw
Mr. Dalken hurrying to join the group of young
friends.
</p>

<p>“Oh, Polly! I had a ’phone message from
John—he says Anne and he just got in at Grand
Central and would hurry here in a taxi. He must
be almost here by this time, I judge, so you keep
on the look-out for them, will you? I have so
many other things to attend to,” was Mr. Dalken’s
request.
</p>

<p>“All right, Dalky! Go on and do your duty,
but don’t kill yourself working for others—as you
always do,” laughed Polly, waving a hand at
him.
</p>

<p>“There, Polly! Now you’d better come with
me and stand at the rail to watch for your brother
and Anne,” advised Tom, anxiously.
</p>

<p>“Yes? and have you stand there and talk nonsense
to me, eh,” laughed Polly, softly, in order
that others might not hear.
</p>

<p>Tom bit his lip. Polly knew she was uncharitable,
but she rebelled at Tom’s constant tagging
her when she wanted to enjoy the company of
other friends, too, and she generally spoke impulsively
and regretted it later.
</p>

<p>At this crisis between the two conditional lovers,
Eleanor unconsciously played the good fairy
by drawing Polly’s attention to a little side-play
between Elizabeth and Pete Maynard. They had
quietly withdrawn from the group of young people
and were now enjoying a tête-à-tête back of
the funnel which acted as a partial screen for
them.
</p>

<p>“I just wanted to say that Elizabeth’s mother
has trained her carefully to encourage only such
young men as can show an attractive bank-roll.
Totty never deigned to notice Ken and Paul, but
quickly attached herself to Pete. Well, Pete is
playing the same game as Elizabeth’s mother
plays, and Dad knows too much to let Pete use
<span class='it'>his</span> money for fortune hunters!” was Eleanor’s
sarcastic remark.
</p>

<p>“But you must remember, Nolla, Totty isn’t
what one might call a fortune-hunter, any more
than Pete is. Mr. Dalken has no other heir to
his wealth, and some day Elizabeth will have
more than she can use,” remonstrated Polly.
</p>

<p>“Pooh! Mr. Dalken is a handsome youngish
man, Polly, and our Mrs. Courtney is a fascinating,
lonely youngish woman—there!”
</p>

<p>At such frank match-making between the two
girls, Tom Latimer gasped. The girls laughed at
his shocked expression, and Eleanor added in a
whisper: “Tom, old dear, why do you think Elizabeth’s
mother sent her on this cruise with the
father who is so heartily detested by the social
moth, and has been completely ignored for
years?”
</p>

<p>“W-e-ell,” stammered Tom, innocently, “I’m
sure I don’t know. Now that you mention it, I
think I can see a little light.”
</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed as she patted Tom on the
back. “That’s a good boy! Go to the head of
the class!”
</p>

<p>Just as a taxi drove recklessly up to the wharf,
the whistle on the yacht blew a terrific blast.
Every one glanced apprehensively at the pilot
house to see what this meant. Surely the Captain
had no intentions of leaving then and there!
Mr. Dalken was seen to hurry to the Captain’s
room to inquire into the unexpected signal.
</p>

<p>John and Anne hurried on board and were
soon surrounded by welcoming friends, Polly the
center of the group. All concern over the whistle
was forgotten in the gossip about the gold mine
and all the doings at Pebbly Pit Ranch. Anne
had many packages to deliver to Polly from her
mother, and John had advices galore from her
father.
</p>

<p>At a second warning call from the ear-splitting
siren Mr. Dalken came hurrying from the
Captain’s room. His face expressed impatience
as he joined his friends. They paused in their
noisy conversation to hear what he wished to say.
</p>

<p>“Captain Blake tells me that the pilot he has
on board to take us out as far as Sandy Hook
declares he will leave this boat unless he can get
started at once. He avers that he is losing the
tide, as well as other jobs he signed up for. If
he leaves us that means we will have to delay our
start until to-morrow,” explained Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” sounded from several young
throats, as their owners crowded about Mr. Dalken
to give good reasons why they should start
at once.
</p>

<p>“But we just got here!” cried John in a disappointed
tone.
</p>

<p>“That’s your loss—you ought to collect damages
from the Twentieth Century Limited,” retorted
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Oh, if only John and Anne would remain on
board with us and go as far as Jacksonville, where
we expect to touch to pick up Nolla’s father!” exclaimed
Polly, eagerly.
</p>

<p>“Say, John, that’s a capital idea! Why not do
it?” asked Mr. Dalken, quickly.
</p>

<p>“What of my baggage at the Grand Central—and
the rooms we wired to hold for us from today?”
queried John.
</p>

<p>“I’ll see to the trunk, John, and one of the
others will cancel the reservation at the hotel,”
offered Kenneth Evans.
</p>

<p>During the eager talk occasioned by Polly’s
suggestion, Tom Latimer seemed very thoughtful.
When it was finally decided that John and his
wife would remain as Mr. Dalken’s guests as far
as Florida, Tom deliberately spoke up! “I’ll reconsider
my refusal to be one of your party as
far as Jacksonville, Mr. Dalken. John and I
have so many important business matters to discuss
at once, that this short voyage will give us
the opportunity we need.”
</p>

<p>Polly looked amazed, and a general smile rippled
the faces of all the others present. They
knew only too well what Tom’s important business
matters consisted of.
</p>

<p>“That’s too bad of you, Tom,” exclaimed
Polly, daringly. “I had hoped to have a few
words with my brother myself; now that all your
time will be engaged in business affairs I shall
have to attach my company to another champion
until we reach Florida.”
</p>

<p>Tom sulked at these words and a number of
the friends in the group laughed outright. But
the sudden shrill blast overhead summarily disposed
of such trifles as a lover’s scene. “There!”
declared Mr. Dalken. “That’s the last call he’ll
give us, he said. If we don’t obey his orders he’ll
leave at once.”
</p>

<p>This rude manner of sending his guests away
seemed to hurt Mr. Dalken’s gentle heart, but his
friends laughed at his concern.
</p>

<p>Midst shouts of goodbys and many advices to
the would-be mariners, the visiting party hurried
from the yacht, leaving Tom and John and Anne
on deck with those remaining for the cruise.
</p>

<p>Just as the friends on shore hoped to see the
sailor cast off the rope which had been looped
about the heavy post on the wharf, a frenzied cry
from a young man seen to be racing like mad
down the walk to the dock, drew all attention that
way. Even the Captain watched the sprinter to
see what might be wrong at the last minute.
</p>

<p>It turned out to be Jim Latimer laden with
boxes of bon bons and flowers. He had sent Ken
on ahead to tell the girls he was hunting in the locality
for proper little memos of his faithful love
for them all, but Kenneth had forgotten to mention
it.
</p>

<p>“Heigh, there!” shouted Jim, furiously, to the
man he saw grinning from the pilot house, “don’t
you start until I get on with these presents!”
</p>

<p>Jim’s father tried to prevent his son from
springing on board the yacht where all hands were
hastening to cast off, but Jim had not become an
expert football player on Yale’s team for nothing.
</p>

<p>In a few giant leaps he was on board and in a
few more strides he joined the young people.
Naturally the young contingent congratulated him
upon arriving just in time, and the elders laughed
tolerantly.
</p>

<p>“Think I was going to chase all over the West
Side for decent candies and flowers and then get
left at the last moment?” demanded Jim, mopping
his perspiring face with his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>“You’re just in time to say goodby and get off
again,” hinted his brother Tom, who felt that his
temperamental younger brother might interrupt
his planned tête-à-têtes with Polly that evening.
</p>

<p>“Leave nothing!” retorted Jim. “I’ll get off
where you do.” His hearers laughed.
</p>

<p>“I’m sailing with them as far as Florida,” remarked
Tom, coolly.
</p>

<p>“Yeh! Then so am I!” was all Jim said, as
he turned away to look for Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>A last and final shriek from the whistle
sounded, and at the same time a voice bawled out
orders. The Captain was seen watching the group
of young friends, but his face looked like a black
thunder-cloud. It was evident to all that not
only the Captain, but the owner of the yacht, as
well, were in no good humor at the behavior of
the pilot. But the pilot cared nothing for friendship
or lovers, and he did care for his capacity to
earn dollars.
</p>

<p>Paul shouted to his companions to run for the
gang-plank, when he saw two sailors stand ready
to cast off. Before Paul could warn his friends
of the need of haste, a loud voice bawled: “Stand
ready to cast off lines!” Then quickly followed
the command: “Cast off!”
</p>

<p>At the same moment the ropes which had
moored the yacht to her dock were deftly thrown,
and in another minute the beautiful craft was
under way. Mr. Dalken stood amazed at such
action, and the young men thus trapped and about
to be carried away on the voyage, began to stutter
and stammer and wonder what had best be done.
</p>

<p>The girls, considering the manner in which
their gallants had been duly warned and then punished
for not obeying the orders, laughed uneasily
at the result of such deafness to the siren’s command.
On the pier stood a group of wide-eyed,
open-mouthed elders who felt on the verge of
nervous collapse when they had time to remember
that this departing vessel was bound for South
America, and those young men were not prepared
to take that trip.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken ran to the Captain’s quarters and
there he remained, instead of returning to the
deck to comfort the troubled souls of the male admirers
who had been so neatly snared.
</p>

<p>The yacht ran smoothly through the tawny
waters of the Hudson River, and headed for the
Statue of Liberty. Though the girls, as well as the
trapped boys, were deeply concerned over the outcome
of this action on the Captain’s part, they
confessed to each other that it was thrilling when
one realized how neatly they had been kidnapped.
And then, too, what jolly times they all might
have on the days and nights of this marvellous
cruise!
</p>

<p>Tom reminded Polly, as the yacht shot past the
Statue, of that experience they had shared the
night that same yacht collided with the ferryboat
in the fog, and the unexpected dive and swim they
were given—a swim that all but ended fatally for
Polly.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth had joined the other young people
by this time, and she asked to be told the circumstance
of that adventure on Bedloe’s Island.
While describing that thrilling incident, Tom
gave his attention to Elizabeth, thus he failed to
notice that Polly slipped away. She had seen
Mrs. Courtney laughing and whispering with
some one hidden back of the door which opened
to the private corridor of the Captain’s quarters,
and she believed she knew who was standing there
imparting such amusing news to the lady.
</p>

<p>Unseen by Mrs. Courtney, Polly managed to
come up quite unexpectedly and overheard Mr.
Dalken remarking: “So you see they will be
taught a necessary lesson at the same time.”
</p>

<p>It was too late to change the topic, or to screen
the man who imparted this information, hence
Mrs. Courtney laughed softly and begged Polly
to keep the secret. Both she and Mr. Dalken
were sure Polly had overheard all that had just
been said. In truth, Polly allowed them to remain
under that impression, but she knew little
more than she had before she surprised them.
</p>

<p>The three sauntered away from the Captain’s
quarters, and Polly remarked: “Well, we have
much to be grateful for, Dalky. Especially for
the Captain’s unusual consideration for young
maids’ preference for the company of young men.
He shows he was young himself at one time!”
Then she laughed merrily.
</p>

<p>“Yes; that is what he said just now, when I demanded
an excuse for his unwarranted action of
adding all those extra appetites to my list of passengers.
We’ll run short of rations long before
we touch at Cuba,” said Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>The anxious young men now saw their host approaching,
and Tom hurried forward to meet him
and ask for an explanation. Having been told
how amazed Mr. Dalken felt at the manner in
which the Captain had acted, the disgusted young
man glanced inadvertently across the Harbor.
</p>

<p>Polly, watching Mr. Dalken’s face for a cue
to this hoax, saw him strive to bite his nether lip
in order to keep from laughing outright. This
instantly relieved her mind of any doubts, for she
knew Mr. Dalken would not feel like laughing if
the carrying off of the group of young men had
been accidental. As it now seemed, the whole
plan had been a trick.
</p>

<p>The yacht skimmed on without as much as a
swerve inland to denote that the Captain was
softening his heart and was disposed to land his
stolen passengers at any dock along the way. The
men thus stolen began to frown heavily and every
last one of them forgot to make the most of this
opportunity to converse with the young ladies
they had found so charming a short time before.
</p>

<p>Finally the craft neared Sandy Hook. As the
distance between the Station and the yacht seemed
to diminish, a stranger in uniform came down
from the pilot house and approached Mr. Dalken.
He held out a hand and spoke in a low
murmur. Mr. Dalken laughed and nodded his
head.
</p>

<p>The yacht swept up alongside a small power
boat which had apparently kept the same course
as the White Crest, and the uniformed stranger
turned to the wondering group of young persons.
“I’m going ashore in my launch, but there may be
room for a few extra passengers in case any one
here fears sea-sickness and prefers to return to
land.”
</p>

<p>At this unexpected invitation, a rush of eager
young men fell upon the pilot and in one voice
begged to be taken ashore. The laughter from
Mr. Dalken and his adult guests soon explained
the joke. But the host would not let the departing
guests go in peace.
</p>

<p>“I’m shocked, boys, to find you are afraid of
sea-sickness and choose to go ashore rather than
take a chance with us! Well, now that my girls
see for themselves what your courage amounts
to, they may decide to marry other young men
they are sure to find in South America.”
</p>

<p>The farewells spoken at this parting were
short, and needed no more than half a minute to
finish. The pilot smiled grimly as he said: “Quite
different from those long-drawn-out goodbys you
boys kept on saying while at the dock!”
</p>

<p>Down in the launch, the young men who now
liked to call themselves “The Castaways,” waved
their hats and sang a farewell song while the little
chugging craft started away for land.
</p>

<p>Eleanor sighed as she turned away from the
rail. “That was the first adventure on our outward
bound itinerary. What next, I wonder?”
</p>

<p>“Well, I can tell you something we <span class='it'>forgot</span> to
do, because of all this excitement over those
boys!” exclaimed Polly, impatiently. Then she
continued in a no less angry tone: “We had
planned just how we would stand at the stern of
the yacht and wave our hands and sing a farewell
to our dear people waiting at the end of the pier
to see the very last speck of us, and then we sail
away and not as much as a <span class='it'>thought</span> do we fling at
them! I feel quite guilty when I think of all my
friends watching anxiously for one last look from
me!”
</p>

<p>Polly’s voice had an audible regret in its tone
as she ended her sentence, but Mrs. Courtney
quickly changed the regret to merriment. “Oh,
my dear! They never remembered you were on
board. Every one in that crowd on the dock was
so flustered over the fears of those boys being
taken on this trip and then hearing from you girls
that they all were married off as seemed best, that
they were calling, running about for help, signaling,
and what not, to cause the yacht to turn back
and deposit those heart-breakers safely beside the
parental authority once more.”
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III—THE FIRST NIGHT OUT</h1>

<p>While sampling the tiers of candies—each box
vying with another in artistic decorations—and
then sniffing at the pyramids of flowers sent by
loving friends to the voyagers, the girls gossiped
of the recent events, the first experiences of their
trip South.
</p>

<p>From this form of light conversation, the talk
drifted to the discussion of the weather and the
waves. The sea was not as smooth and glassy
as it might have been, and the vessel these bragging
maids were now on was not as firm and quiet
under foot as the Oceanic or the Aquitania. In
fact, every huge roller seemed to heave the dainty
White Crest up at one end and let it drop at the
other. This rather unpleasant tumbling created a
slight sense of discomfort in the bosoms of the
passengers.
</p>

<p>Several boxes of the richest bon bons had been
emptied by the group of girls before Mrs.
Courtney came in to join them. The moment she saw
the boxes, and the girls lounging about nibbling
at the sweets, she declared anxiously: “Oh, my
dears! Better not eat candy to-night, you know.
If we come into smoother water before to-morrow
you will have ample time to finish these boxes
of candy.”
</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed, with the suggestion of a
sneer in her tone. “Any one would think, dear
Mrs. Courtney, that we were not good sailors.
<span class='it'>You</span> might find it necessary to deprive yourself
of certain good things to eat, but <span class='it'>I</span> have crossed
several times and I am <span class='it'>never</span> troubled with
<span class='it'>mal de mer</span>.”
</p>

<p>“Polly and I never felt a qualm when we went
over last year; but that was on a great gigantic
steamer that felt different from this rocking.”
As Eleanor spoke she dropped a tempting chocolate
cream back into the box.
</p>

<p>“I was about to remark, just as Mrs. Courtney
came in, that it might be wiser for us to defer
sampling the rest of the candy until to-morrow.
This unusual rocking between the tops and the
bottoms of the waves is a bit uncanny—don’t you
agree with me?” Polly looked concerned at the
sensation she felt.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed unkindly. “You are in for
a lovely time, my dear child!”
</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve crossed three times myself,” now
said Nancy Fabian, “but I will admit that this upheaval
of the waves is causing me to worry some
over my emotions.” Her friends laughed.
</p>

<p>“This sea-sick business is only a matter of self-control,
I think!” declared Elizabeth, with a
superior smile. “Naturally, if one dreads it, one
will feel more uncertain of keeping up. Now <span class='it'>I</span>
never permit myself to dwell upon the disgusting
thought of such a condition, and I am as regular
at the table each meal as the old sea-seasoned
Captains. I have been complimented by the Captains
on having good sea-going nerves.”
</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney listened but offered no contribution
to the conversation. Polly was about to
make a remark when a tap at the door drew the
attention of the occupants of the room.
</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Eleanor, who sat nearest the
door. It was a uniformed boy who came to announce
afternoon tea on deck. “Mr. Dalken
says to tell you’se all that every one is there
waitin’ fer ye’se.”
</p>

<p>“All right, thank you. We’ll be there in a
moment,” said Eleanor, then she closed the door
again. “Any one here want tea? We have had
so much candy that I don’t see how we can eat
cake or buns.”
</p>

<p>“We will go up and join the others, however,”
added Mrs. Courtney, rising to lead the way from
the state room.
</p>

<p>“But, my dears!” exclaimed Elizabeth in
shocked tones. “<span class='it'>Surely</span> you would not sit down
to afternoon tea in these street suits?”
</p>

<p>“Of course, Elizabeth. Your father made it
very plain that this was to be a rest and pleasure
voyage, and not one for dress or social customs.
We were asked to live exactly as if we were at
home in our own little apartments with no one
but family members near,” explained Mrs. Courtney,
kindly.
</p>

<p>“Well, that may do all right for you, Mrs.
Courtney, but I, for one, shall never lower my
dignity and social prestige to such a degree that
I would have to feel like apologizing to myself
for my appearances.” With this rude explanation
Elizabeth flounced from the room and went directly
to her own stateroom.
</p>

<p>Her erstwhile companions, believing she would
change her dress and make an elaborate toilet before
joining her father’s guests on deck, paid no
further attention to her absence. But they hurried
out of the room where Elizabeth had indulged
in overmuch sweets and fruits, and were
soon ensconced in comfortable chairs on deck
with the elders who were sipping fragrant tea and
enjoying tea cakes.
</p>

<p>Tom made room on the divan for Polly, and
she had not the initiative to refuse to sit beside
him. She could not describe the lack of interest
she felt in her friends, or the glorious sky and
weather. John and Anne were laughing and
exchanging their opinions with Mr. Dalken on
the quality of his chef. It was the mutual vote of
those present that the cook was a genuine find.
John even said it was an appeal to the male to remain
on the yacht and continue the trip to the
Andes.
</p>

<p>The crispy brown cakes were so tempting, and
the high praise from the men sounded so alluring,
that the girls helped themselves to the refreshments
provided. An unusually heavy roller
caused a little tremor in the minds of most of the
mariners, but the sandwiches and cakes were not
neglected for such a small cause.
</p>

<p>“Why, of all things!” cried Polly, glancing at
the coast line which was standing out clearly
defined from the changing hues in the sky. “Here
we are off Atlantic Highlands already! It seems
just a moment since we passed Sandy Hook.”
</p>

<p>“At this rate I fear we will land in Peru long
before we are ready to leave the ship,” laughed
Eleanor, munching on a chicken sandwich.
</p>

<p>For the space of half an hour thereafter, the
group of gourmands (self-styled as gourmands
because they ate so much of the delicious viands
provided by the chef) admired the setting sun and
the colors reflected in the sea by the clouds. No
one had missed Elizabeth as yet, because every
one was busy with the tea table. But now Mr.
Dalken glanced uneasily around at the faces so
familiar to him, and wondered aloud: “Why,
where is Totty?”
</p>

<p>His companions glanced from one to the other,
and Mrs. Courtney, fearing lest Polly in her
frankness might blurt out the truth about suitable
dressing for tea, explained: “Elizabeth left us
to go to her own room to change her dress. She
thought the tailor-made street suit rather heavy
and uncomfortable for lounging about a tea
table.”
</p>

<p>Those who had heard Elizabeth’s unkind
remark to Mrs. Courtney silently commended her
kind interpretation of the girl’s sentence. Mr.
Dalken, believing his daughter would soon appear,
felt satisfied to wait for her coming. Then
the sudden sinking to the horizon of the great
sun-ball of red caused various exclamations of
admiration, and also drew the friends to that side
of the yacht where the sunset could be seen to the
greatest advantage.
</p>

<p>As the sun set the wind rose. In a short time
a perfect gale was tearing across the waters, and
the waves rose accordingly. In fact, so mighty
became the rollers, and so uncertain the footing
on board the yacht, that it was a risk for the
“land-lubbers” to attempt to walk recklessly about
the deck. Giant waves, every now and then,
washed over the swiftly flying yacht and sprayed
the voyagers with salty drops, and Mr. Dalken
advised them all to go in and rest before dinner
was announced.
</p>

<p>Perhaps it was due to obeying his advice to lie
down for a short time; perhaps it was the partaking
of too much of the delicious viands provided
by the jewel of a chef; perhaps it was just
plain old sea sickness—but whatever it was, let
it here be stated that only two adults appeared in
the dining room that evening for dinner: Mrs.
Courtney and Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>Having waited and waited for the appearance
of the others in their party, and having ascertained
by continued perseverance of a questionnaire,
in the form of a ’phone, that his guests
preferred to dine in bed, Mr. Dalken finally concluded
to eat. Therefore he sent word by said
’phone to ascertain how many trays would be
wanted by sick friends.
</p>

<p>The reply caused Mrs. Courtney a hearty
laugh, while Mr. Dalken found ample pleasure
for the next week in referring to that night’s experience,
and to their curt thanks to his humanitarian
impulses.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth had not joined her father’s guests at
tea that late afternoon for the very good reason
that she threw herself upon the bed in her room
and was glad enough to remain there for several
days. She had eaten three times as much candy
and fruit as any one of her companions, and now
she was paying the price for self-indulgence.
Where now were all her brags about being such a
splendid sailor!
</p>

<p>It was not an individual weakness on the part
of Polly and Eleanor that they succumbed to the
attack of sea sickness soon after they reached
their small rooms. But they were not aware at
the time that <span class='it'>all</span> adults, excepting Mr. Dalken
and Mrs. Courtney, had decided against dining
that night, and remained in their own rooms instead.
Had the two girls dreamed of the truth,
that the two pawns in their match-making game
were enjoying a tête-à-tête dinner and evening
together, this knowledge would have done much
to console them for their weird sensations within.
</p>

<p>As the evening advanced the gale increased,
and those who felt too ill to leave their beds
feared lest they <span class='it'>might</span> survive till morning. The
yacht could not sink quick enough to please them.
Elizabeth was one of this group of morbid sailors.
The members of the other group who felt
able to hold up their heads and take a squint at
the turbulent waters and sky now and then when
the craft seemed to spin about on a pivot, or suddenly
soar to the sky and as quickly change its
course to sink to the bottom of the sea, prayed
and prayed that the shores of Florida might loom
up within the next few hours—that they might
go ashore.
</p>

<p>These prayers, being selfish ones, were not answered,
and the coast of Florida remained where
it had been placed in the order of arranging the
New World.
</p>

<p>Having managed to drag herself across her
room to the porthole, Polly looked out to see
whether the moon was the next stop. She thought
the yacht had been going, prow upwards, for the
last hour. To her amazement she saw they were
still on the sea, but such a sea! So tumbled and
troubled that she wished for oil to pour upon it.
</p>

<p>Eleanor and Polly shared one room, and now
Eleanor lifted her head and wailed: “What do
you see, Poll?”
</p>

<p>“I see sea, that’s all. Oh, my head!” and
Polly fell into a chair and caught her head between
her hands.
</p>

<p>In spite of her wish to die, Eleanor could not
refrain from laughing at her chum. “I should
have said you see saw, instead of see sea, judging
from the ‘now we go up, and now we go down’
behavior of the board we are on.”
</p>

<p>But no answering smile came from Polly’s somber
face.
</p>

<p>Eleanor, not to be discouraged in her wish to
help her friend cheer up, murmured: “If we feel
this way, Poll, how do you suppose precious Totty
is doing?”
</p>

<p>This struck Polly’s sense of humor at the right
moment. She had to laugh in spite of her wish
to ponder on death and the hereafter. The picture
of Elizabeth as she bragged of her seamanship,
gave cause to a duet of merriment from the
two girls. This acted like a tonic, and thenceforth
they began to feel easier. Then, too, the
gale had spent its fury and began gradually to
calm down.
</p>

<p>A soft knock on the door of their room brought
forth the command to come in. Mrs. Courtney,
looking magnificent in her simple but elegant dinner
gown entered with a cheerful smile for the
girls.
</p>

<p>“Well, well! Where are the seasoned ocean
travelers?” said she in a quizzing tone.
</p>

<p>“Lost! Went down off Sandy Hook!” retorted
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Who are these shadows in their place?” continued
Mrs. Courtney, teasingly.
</p>

<p>“Never mind who we are,” was Polly’s laughing
rejoinder, “but tell us this much: where is
Elizabeth, and what is she doing?”
</p>

<p>“That I cannot say, my dears, till after Mr.
Dalken comes from his daughter’s room. I left
him just now about to visit her, then I came in
here to see you. I understand she wishes to die
without delay.”
</p>

<p>This seemed to tickle Polly and Eleanor
greatly. They actually exchanged delighted
glances, and Eleanor said: “Serves her right.”
</p>

<p>“Oh, come,” returned Mrs. Courtney, “don’t
say that. The poor child has never had any real
example of what is right and good, so how can
one expect of her what we do of girls like you
and Polly?”
</p>

<p>“Well,” said Polly, swinging her feet out of
bed, “I believe I am able to sit up and enjoy this
visit. The sea must be calming down considerably
from the smooth manner in which the yacht
is moving.”
</p>

<p>But Polly spoke too soon. The moment she
tried to stand upon her feet she swayed uncertainly
and her head spun around like a top. Mrs.
Courtney sprang over and caught her arm and
steadied her till she got back to bed. Eleanor
giggled unmercifully.
</p>

<p>“Better stay put, Poll, till morning. Then
we’ll practice before we show off.”
</p>

<p>All that night the waves which had caused the
pitching and rolling of the vessel kept up a heavy
under-swell that made the yacht shudder and
tremble uncertainly. At times it seemed as if the
great gaping rollers wished to gulp the small
craft in one swallow. But inside the comfortable
rooms of the yacht, the <span class='it'>un</span>comfortable passengers
waited patiently for the heavy seas to quiet down
again.
</p>

<p>After leaving his daughter’s room, Mr. Dalken
went forward to find the First Mate who had
said he had graduated from a medical college out
west. Having found the man, Mr. Dalken called
him by his title of doctor.
</p>

<p>“I have a plan to suggest, Dr. Braxton, which
ought to cure all our seasick passengers. I want
you to visit each one in a professional way and
diagnose their conditions. Do not find any one
suffering from sea sickness, but find some light
cause for their indisposition and be sure and tell
them so. I have an idea that the test of changing
their minds about the cause of their being in bed
will change their physical conditions, too. Will
you do this for me? Take your medicine chest
and leave each one some melted licorice in water.
Tell them to take a tablespoonful of this wonderful
tonic every hour—then we’ll see.”
</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Dalken, you would not have me
tell these poor people that they are not ill with
sea sickness, would you? It would be unkind of
us to do that,” objected the poor young man.
</p>

<p>“Now listen, my good friend. I’ve heard said,
over and over again, that seasickness is mostly
due to fear and <span class='it'>concern</span> over one’s having it. The
pneumogastric nerve acts with the mental condition
of the patient—we all know that. And
this nerve, it is claimed, is directly affected in a
manner to make the ill one think he cannot
move, or get up, or eat. I want to cure my
friends in a hurry, and I want you to help me cure
them. That is real kindness—not unkindness.”
</p>

<p>The interested young man asked what more
would be required of him, and Mr. Dalken explained.
In a short time thereafter, Dr. Braxton
called upon his first patient. It happened to be
Mr. Fabian.
</p>

<p>After using all the usual methods of taking
pulse, looking at the tongue, feeling of the heart,
and taking the temperature, the young physician
said:
</p>

<p>“I’m happy to say, Mr. Fabian, that this attack
is not a case of sea-sickness at all, but acute comatose
condition of the digestive glands. You might
have experienced the same illness had you been
at home. Now I shall leave you this wonderful
remedy to take every hour, and in the morning
you will feel fine. Three doses of this ought to
put you right as a trivet.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian was so glad to hear he had not had
an attack of sea-sickness that he thanked the doctor
and said he felt sure he would be around in
the morning.
</p>

<p>Having visited all the sick-abed members of
Mr. Dalken’s party, and found one suffering from
a slight attack of gastritis, another with rheumatic
neurosis of the abdomen, and many other
queer complaints that have never been heard of
before or since that night, and then having left
the great cure-all medicine for each and every
one stricken, the willing physician went to report
to Mr. Dalken.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV—THE SECOND DAY OUT</h1>

<p>Mr. Dalken enjoyed the joke immensely and
hoped it would benefit his friends as he had
planned it should. During the night the sea
calmed so that by dawn it presented a beautiful
surface of small playful waves. Consequently
the yacht danced over the waters like a happy
nautilus, but the tossing had ceased.
</p>

<p>During the night the vessel had made wonderful
headway and by breakfast time the Captain
said they were opposite Old Point Comfort. The
information gave rise to puns, because every member
in the party except Elizabeth, presented himself
at the table, ready for a hearty meal, but
one and all maintained that their improvement
was due to Old Point Comfort.
</p>

<p>Upon comparing notes of their illnesses, and
the dark brown medicine given by the young doctor,
the patients found they had been given
diluted licorice; Mr. Dalken had visited his
daughter several times during the night, and again
in the morning, but she complained that he disturbed
her rest every time he came in. Therefore
he decided not to annoy her until she felt
better.
</p>

<p>When asked by Mrs. Courtney whether it
would be advisable to take a light breakfast to
Elizabeth and attend her, Mr. Dalken replied:
“Better leave her absolutely alone for a short
time. She may recover sooner.”
</p>

<p>In spite of ravenous appetites and the temptation
of the dainty dishes sent to the breakfast
table, the mariners, so recently recovering from
the effects of the wild waves of the night before,
found a sudden relapse of well remembered conditions
the moment any food touched their tongue
and palate. Thus the alluring breakfast had to
be sent back to the kitchen with regrets.
</p>

<p>That day the convalescents, as Mr. Dalken persisted
in calling his guests, preferred to keep quiet,
amusing themselves with the periodicals liberally
provided in the lounging room, or chatting on
deck and watching the curling waves against the
speeding yacht.
</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, just before tea was
served on deck, Elizabeth came from her room,
looking very pathetic in spite of the touch of
rouge on her cheeks, and color on her lips. Mr.
Dalken sprang up to assist her to a chair, but she
refused his support with an impatient toss of her
head. Consequently, the vessel giving a sudden
graceful curve, Elizabeth was thrown head first
into Mr. Ashby’s arms.
</p>

<p>“My! It’s not often that an old man has such
an armful of loveliness tossed him by the generous
sea,” laughed Mr. Ashby, as he assisted Elizabeth
to her feet. He understood the way to calm a
young woman’s chagrin, and compliment her at
the same time.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth had not heard of the graduate physician’s
visits to the other sea sick guests, nor of
the dark brown medicine he had prescribed in
obedience to Mr. Dalken’s orders. Hence she
believed she had been the one who received all the
medical attentions and the dose.
</p>

<p>“Dear me, I have had such an attack of cerebral
neuritis,” commenced she, sighing to attract
sympathy. “Unfortunately, this attack came over
me from the unusual excitement due to preparing
for this cruise. The doctor says I need more rest
and a nerve tonic. I never call in such
inexperienced doctors at home, but this one seems to know
exactly what to do in my case.”
</p>

<p>Elizabeth glanced at Mrs. Courtney, then at
her father, in order to assure herself that they
had comprehended what she had said. Mrs.
Courtney seemed to be politely intent upon the
girl’s words, and Mr. Dalken smiled lovingly at
his daughter. Elizabeth failed to read any suspicion
of amusement in their expressions, so she
proceeded.
</p>

<p>“You know, I never am sea-sick—<span class='it'>never</span>! And
I wondered if the rest of you would think that
my indisposition might be an attack of the unpleasant
sensations which generally prostrate inexperienced
seafarers. It was rather disconcerting
that this attack of nervous trouble should return
the first day out at sea.” Elizabeth now
glanced around at the faces about her. She felt
a bit piqued at the hardly controlled expressions
of one or two of them.
</p>

<p>Eleanor, with her blunt honesty and impatience
with any form of subterfuge, blurted out unexpectedly:
“I, too, was indisposed, Elizabeth; but
the wise young doctor informed me that I <span class='it'>never</span>
could be sea-sick—my trouble was eating too
much candy, and the volume of water which was
playing fast and loose with the yacht. He gave
me this dark brown medicine to take, and assured
me that the moment the gale subsided my nausea
would disappear.”
</p>

<p>As Eleanor spoke she took a small bottle from
her bag and held it out in plain view of Elizabeth
and the others in the amused circle of friends.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked in dismay, recognized the
color of the medicine, then glanced about at the
smiling faces of those who also had taken the
doctor’s medicine.
</p>

<p>“Is this a joke you wish to play on me?” demanded
she.
</p>

<p class='caption wx400'>“IS THIS A JOKE YOU WISH TO PLAY ON ME?”</p>
</div>

<p>“It wasn’t a joke last night, I can tell you, Elizabeth,”
exclaimed Polly, bringing her vial to view
and shaking her head deploringly as she studied
the brown liquid. “If every one on this ship felt
as I did, they’d never have thought of a doctor
or medicine, let alone any licorice water.”
</p>

<p>The laugh caused by Polly’s admission failed
to soothe Elizabeth. She was furious, but managed
to demand: “Who of this group was ill?”
In this manner she thought to detect the ones who
had taken such amusement in fooling their friends.
</p>

<p>One after another in the circle admitted the
truth, but Mrs. Courtney confessed to having
spent her evening with Polly and Eleanor. That
left Mr. Dalken alone. He smiled as he said:
“Well, I am forced to confess that I am the guilty
one. I prescribed the doctor and his doses.”
</p>

<p>As Elizabeth could not very well denounce her
father for having played this practical joke on
his friends as well as on herself, she merely tossed
her head and turned her back upon him. He
smiled to himself, then caught Polly’s glance
which told him she understood the cause of his
daughter’s annoyance. Also he read a sympathy
in her heart for the misunderstanding so deliberately
displayed by the girl.
</p>

<p>Fortunately for the situation the boy now came
forward and began preparations to serve tea.
Having arranged the wicker table in front of
Mrs. Courtney, without a look or word to Mrs.
Fabian or Mrs. Ashby who were in the circle, he
left again to fetch the tea service. Directly behind
the well-bred young servant came an uncouth
Scandinavian youth carrying a heavy tray of
viands.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken had not seen nor had anything to
do with engaging the individuals in the crew on
his yacht, as that was part of his Captain’s work.
And up to this moment Mr. Dalken had never
seen this great overgrown Swede. But the blonde
giant had no intentions of being ignored, as he
soon made plain.
</p>

<p>He planked his tray forcibly upon the table
beside the tea service wagon, and then turned to
Mr. Dalken. No introduction was needed for
him. He was too disturbed to consider aught but
his injured feelings.
</p>

<p>“Dot tea what yun Shink meks me fer supper,
Oi not drink. Oi tek cuffee er Oi go home!” exclaimed
he with ire.
</p>

<p>Several of the voyagers had been quietly admiring
the low-lying banks of soft cirrus clouds,
and some had been engaged in absent-mindedly
watching the man servant arrange the tea table,
when the Swede exploded his complaint in a loud
thunderous tone.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken gave a start. He was too surprised
at the unlooked for complaint to control
the nervous action. He frowned at the ponderous
youth, then waved him away. Turning to
the other man he told him to serve; then he followed
the wondering Swede down the promenade
deck to the culinary quarters.
</p>

<p>As Mr. Dalken disappeared to view, Elizabeth
smiled a tantalizing smile and remarked, to no
one in particular: “Dear me! I cannot understand
why Daddy engages such inexperienced
servants. He always did neglect important
things.”
</p>

<p>An ominous silence followed this information
from Elizabeth, then Mr. Ashby gayly proposed
a diversion which interested his friends till Mr.
Dalken rejoined the group.
</p>

<p>Not having heard his daughter’s criticism Mr.
Dalken reseated himself and smiled as he began:
“I investigated the cause of that young chap’s
complaint, because I could not very well consent
to his walking back home—not on the water,
you know. And I discovered a most amusing
affair back in the kitchen. Want to hear the
tale?”
</p>

<p>Every one but Elizabeth signified eagerly a desire
to hear the story. She pretended indifference
to her father and his experience in the kitchen.
But he did not see her face and laughingly began
his narrative.
</p>

<p>“I learned that the Chef treats the crew with
unusual consideration by serving the same quality
tea that we drink. That poor Scandinavian lad
had never before sailed with a decent crew, it
seems. In the past he has been the butt for all
the deep-sea sailors who sailed from their Swedish
ports on tramp steamers or fishing boats.
</p>

<p>“Captain Blake tells me that Jansen is a fine
youth and very conscientious, but too blunt for
his own good. In his past experiences he has only
had the cheapest black coffee served, or a weak
sort of bitter drink faintly colored that went by
the name of tea. The Captain explained to me
that such tea is made from used tea-leaves which
are dried by enterprising men and stained with
chemicals to produce a brown liquid with a strong
flavor. Naturally, he said, such second-hand tea
leaves are not any too clean. The driers do not
spend time on seeing to it that the leaves are kept
free from vermin and dirt. Hence it often happens
that sailors find unexpected dregs mixed with
their tea leaves in the bottom of the pannikins in
which they receive their measure of so-called tea.”
</p>

<p>As Mr. Dalken reached this part of his story
Elizabeth gave a shudder and exclaimed in a horror-stricken
tone: “Oh, Daddy! How <span class='it'>can</span> you
be so ordinary as to speak of such horrible things?
Any one would think you were just common.
What does it matter to us whether these plebeian
seamen drink tea or salt water, as long as we are
not subjected to their coarse modes of living?”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken turned to stare at Elizabeth, and
his frown should have warned her of further pursuing
such a line of condemnation. But Elizabeth
was bent on punishing her father for having
made her—so she deemed it—the laughing stock
of his friends by sending in a doctor who gave her
licorice water to cure a serious attack of cerebral
neuritis, though Elizabeth was not quite sure
what such a dreadful disease was.
</p>

<p>“You have forgotten, I suppose, because of the
recent years of your not associating with the best
society, that subjects of food are not considered
permissible. But the very idea of any one in
my class of friends, daring to broach a story such
as you just began—all about vermin—would have
instantly caused him to be excluded from us,” concluded
she.
</p>

<p>Polly stared unbelievingly at the girl who
dared say such things to a father; and the others
in the group who considered themselves intimate
friends of Mr. Dalken’s, could not but interpret
the insolent girl’s speech as personal affronts: had
they not been her father’s closest associates for
the past few years? The society which she daringly
condemned as not being good for him?
</p>

<p>What may have been the result of this
indiscreet speech from Elizabeth could not be said,
but Mrs. Courtney, in her wisdom, instantly rose
to the call for immediate action of some sort.
The Captain had just announced a “change of
watch on board.” She caught at the idea.
</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! Mr. Dalken! The Captain is about
to change the watch. Cannot you take us there
and explain how this interesting act is accomplished?”
As she spoke the wily woman sprang
from her chair, and took two or three eager steps
in the direction of the group of sailors now appearing
before the Captain.
</p>

<p>Instantly all the other members in the circle
seated at the tea table sprang up, only too thankful
to catch at a straw by which to save the situation.
Mr. Dalken also rose and led the way down
the promenade deck in the direction of the Captain.
Elizabeth remained in her chair, shrugging
her shoulders in a decidedly French manner.
</p>

<p>Having heard the Captain explain how changes
of watch were made on vessels, the group of
friends eagerly accepted his offer to conduct them
over the entire yacht. They were introduced to
the chef who had been called the “Shink” by the
Swedish boy. They met and felt an interest in
the overgrown, inexperienced youth of fifteen who
seemed like a hearty man of twenty-five. He
grinned sheepishly when Polly selected him to
address her admiration of his qualities of seamanship—as
the Captain had explained it.
</p>

<p>Then they were introduced to the capable young
Belgian waiter, Johann, who was always well-bred
and attentive.
</p>

<p>Shink, the Chinese cook, felt so nattered by the
visit of many pretty women to his domain that
his rather incomprehensible manner of speaking
English became choked and jumbled. Such a
medley of consonants and vowels as he poured
forth in a continuous flood by his twisting tongue,
caused his visitors to gasp in breathless amazement.
In his endeavors to show “Honorable
Boss Fren’s” all the courtesy due their Most Honorable
Selves, Shink bowed and chattered, even
after the Most Honorable Party had gone.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Oriental’s peace of mind,
and the welfare of the Swede the latter had
stepped outside the kitchen to make more room
for the visitors. As the group of Mr. Dalken’s
guests were leaving the kitchen by another
door from that entered by them, a great crash of
china was heard by the excitable Shink. He
leaped to the door and discovered the cause.
Poor Wooden-top, as the Swedish lad was nicknamed
by his associates, in turning to gaze after
the receding form of Polly to whom his heart was
forever lost, had stubbed his toe against the
raised door sill. The heavy tray of dishes which
he had been carrying aloft went flying through the
door to smash as best suited each individual dish
against the opposite wall.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth was not to be seen when the inspecting
party returned to the lounging place on deck.
But it was soon ascertained that she had retired
to her own room after her friends had left her.
</p>

<p>That evening was a merry one. Dancing and
other diversions were enjoyed by the younger
members of the party, and cards were played by
the older ones, to the entire satisfaction of both
groups. The sea was as calm as a sheet of glass,
but the Captain foretold a storm, though this was
hard to believe when one gazed at the wonderful
starlit sky and felt the clearness of the atmosphere.
</p>

<p>“The Captain says we will soon be off the coast
of Florida, if we keep up this speed,” ventured
Polly, who had stood with the man in charge of
the yacht for a long time that evening after
dinner.
</p>

<p>“And there I shall have to leave you,” whispered
Tom, in a moody tone of voice.
</p>

<p>“You should be thankful that you were granted
this lovely visit with Mr. Dalken’s friends,” returned
Polly, purposely misinterpreting his meaning.
She hoped to steer Tom away from his constant
harping on his love for her, and demanding
her sympathy in his distress over it.
</p>

<p>The temperature had become so balmy and delightful
in the latitudes the yacht had reached,
that it was a pleasure to sit on deck or walk about
while thinking of the sleety, penetratingly cold
air in New York City. Tom, anxious to make
the most of his fast-ending visit on board the
vessel, coaxed Polly to go with him and watch
the moon rise over the quiet sea.
</p>

<p>With a desperate glance behind—much as Lot’s
wife must have given after leaving Sodom to its
fate—Polly sighed and agreed. There seemed
to be no other alternative. Eleanor and Ruth
Ashby had vanished soon after the last dance had
ended, Nancy was deep in a new novel, Elizabeth
was in her own room, and the rest were playing
a new game of cards proposed by Mrs. Ashby.
</p>

<p>Tom, elated at his success in securing Polly’s
undivided company upon such a glorious night,
walked with her to a cosy nook he had found in
the stern of the vessel. Here, seated upon luxurious
chairs which he had commandeered from the
lounge, he felt that any girl should be willing to
watch the frothy wash of the water from the
rapid cleaving of the yacht through its surface,
and listen to an ardent lover who had much to
say in a very short space of time.
</p>

<p>But Polly thought otherwise. She was willing
to watch the churning water thrown this side and
that by the stern of the boat, and she was eager
to see the moon rise from the horizon of the sea,
but she was not keen about hearing, again, the
oft-repeated story of Tom’s love and his heartache
because she would not reciprocate such love.
</p>

<p>Just as long as Tom kept to general topics of
conversation, Polly smiled and showed an interest
in him. But let him launch his love story even
in the least possible manner, and she instantly sat
up and changed the subject to one of the weather,
the moon, or the landing at Jacksonville, where
they were to find friends awaiting the yacht.
</p>

<p>Tom finally rebelled at such treatment.
</p>

<p>“Polly, you are cruel, and you know it! Here
it has been many, many long weeks since Christmas,
when you showed me enough heart to make
me believe that you truly loved me. But you
froze up again, the next day, and since then you
try to make yourself and others believe that you
consider me only in the light of a good friend.
If it takes serious illness or adversity to rouse
your love, I’ll do something desperate to prove
you!” Tom’s threat sounded ominous.
</p>

<p>“Tom, I really think you are mentally deranged.
I’ve told you over and again, that I shall
take ample time to weigh my future life. It’s not
going to be a case of ‘marry in haste; repent at
leisure.’ I have wanted to travel and see the
world, and now that I have the opportunity, it is
sheer selfishness on your part to try to dissuade
me from such joy and pleasure.”
</p>

<p>“Oh, Polly! I am the least selfish lover in the
world. I tag on at your heels and never receive
any mark of your affection. Why, you scarcely
deign to notice me, when other admirers are at
hand.”
</p>

<p>“That’s not true, but I do try to show them the
same attention and consideration that any sensible
girl ought to. I have said emphatically that I am
<span class='it'>not</span> to be considered as having been captured by
you, and the fact that I have to assert myself to
prove it to our friends may make you think it is
as you say. It is your fault that this is so. I prefer
to be impartial and not give myself all the
extra trouble to act as I feel, entirely free and
glad to dance or enjoy the society of other young
men besides yourself.”
</p>

<p>Tom made no reply, but sat staring gloomily
out over the water. Polly sent him a side glance
and thought to herself: “There, that frank
statement ought to hold him for a time, at
least!”
</p>

<p>The two felt that their tête-à-tête had best end
before it terminated in the usual disagreement
regarding love. The sky became mottled with
beautiful drifting clouds which formed slowly into
the long, scaly appearance of what is known as a
“mackerel sky.” The smoothness of the sea had
become a choppy, complaining surface of murmuring
wavelets. The color reflected from the brooding
sky had turned the glassy waters into a grey
ominous sheet.
</p>

<p>Almost within the shaft of light coming from
the saloon lights, Polly and Tom came face to
face with the Captain. He saluted and said:
“Better get ready for a turn to-night. I’ve just
been warning Mr. Dalken, but he seems to think
I am borrowing trouble. If you listen to me, you
will tie yourselves in bed in order to spare yourselves
being rolled out unceremoniously before
dawn.”
</p>

<p>Polly laughed and thanked the amiable Captain,
and Tom stood for a moment after the officer
had left them, and stared out at the sullen
sea.
</p>

<p>“It looks perfectly calm,” remarked Tom.
</p>

<p>“Looks often belie the true condition underneath,”
returned Polly, precociously. Tom
looked at her and laughed appreciatively.
</p>

<p>In the saloon the young people were trying
some of the new popular songs of New York.
But their efforts met with little success, and Tom
interrupted them with his comments.
</p>

<p>“Don’t tease the storm to descend any sooner
by this wailing. The Captain says we shall all be
satisfied with enough groaning and screaming
from the sea and sky long before morning.”
</p>

<p>The Captain’s warning fell unheeded, however,
except by Polly who felt intuitively that the
change she had seen creeping over the sky and
surface of the sea foreboded no good. Therefore,
she persuaded Eleanor, that night, to place
ready at hand her booties and a heavy ulster. She
did the same.
</p>

<p>“But why the ulster, Polly?” asked Eleanor in
amazement.
</p>

<p>“Because, should we have a terrific blow as oft
times happens in these tropical latitudes, it will be
well worth going up on the deck. And we will
need a heavy storm-proof coat to keep us dry.”
</p>

<p>It was past eleven o’clock when the party on
the yacht broke up and every one said good-night
to every one. It was not yet twelve when Polly
advised Eleanor to keep her booties and wraps
at hand in case she wanted to don them in a hurry,
and it was only a few minutes past twelve when,
both girls, having jumped into bed, heard a
strange soughing of the wind and immediately
following that, the confused shouts of the Captain
and his mates to the sailors on board. Both
girls felt the rise of the sea by the way the yacht
dipped and careened as if at the mercy of the
storm.
</p>

<p>“There! The Captain was right when he
warned us of this,” murmured Polly, turning
about in order to get out of her bed.
</p>

<p>The shouting and excitement on deck continued
and Eleanor decided it might be interesting
for her to follow Polly’s example and dress hurriedly
in order to investigate the cause of all the
commotion. Before she could reach out to take
her stockings and shoes, however, she was thrown
violently against the wall at the back of her bed.
Polly, too, was tumbled willy nilly up against the
wash stand.
</p>

<p>“Well! I neve——!” began Eleanor, but she
never completed her exclamation of dismay.
Such a roar and rumble from all sides, and such
shouting and shrieking, drove all ideas from her
active brain.
</p>

<p>The shouts came from the officers outside, the
shrieks from Elizabeth who occupied the neighboring
cabin.
</p>

<p>Hail, great volumes of water, and bits of
debris were hurtled against the glass in the portholes,
and at the same time the awful rolling and
tossing of the vessel added dismay to braver
hearts than that of the spoiled darling of a foolish
mother in New York.
</p>

<p>The storm drove the yacht straight southward,
which was fortunate; also it was a fortunate matter
that the Captain had foreseen this change in
weather and had prepared for it in time. What
he had not expected, and an unusual experience it
was, was the cloud-burst which followed the advance
signals of the hurricane.
</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor had managed to get into
their heavy storm coats and shoes, and were prepared
to leave their room and watch events when
the sound of a heavy metal grating against the
door of the corridor which opened into the living
room of the yacht, made them exchange
glances.
</p>

<p>“That sounds as if we were prisoners. It must
have been the iron bar that the Captain said they
used when there was danger of the heavy seas
breaking the doors open,” said Polly.
</p>

<p>“All the more reason why I should wish to be
out and get the benefit of such a storm,” ventured
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“And all the more reason why I shall hold you
indoors,” instantly retorted Polly.
</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed. “Yet you were the one to
suggest that I get out my coat and shoes, to be
ready to hurry out and watch the storm should
it come our way.”
</p>

<p>“I had no idea that we were bound to run head
first into a hurricane, or a tidal wave! <span class='it'>I</span> meant a
simple, little old-fashioned gale.”
</p>

<p>Suddenly the White Crest lay over on her beam
ends and both girls slid helplessly down against
the wall where they clutched at the smooth door,
trying to hold to something firm and trustworthy.
The sound of the screeching, howling wind now
rose to a deafening shriek which prevented any
one from hearing a word spoken, even though
the speaker was close to one’s ear.
</p>

<p>By sheer means of strength and purpose Polly
managed to drag herself up to a level with the
round porthole, in order to get a look outside.
She steadied herself in this slanting position while
holding fast to the brass hinges and knob of the
heavy-framed glass.
</p>

<p>“Oh, Nolla! It is magnificent! The waves
are a mass of boiling, seething phosphorescence
which actually light the whole sea! If you can
hold fast, try to stand up and see.”
</p>

<p>By dint of clinging to Polly’s legs and then
holding fast to her waist, Eleanor managed to
stand beside her friend just long enough to take
one look at the fearsome sight of the ocean.
</p>

<p>With a hushed cry of dismay Eleanor let go
her hold and in another minute she was rolled
over and over upon the floor with no means of
ending the game of bowls until she had clutched
the leg of her bed.
</p>

<p>“Oh, Polly! I wish I had never looked! I’m
sure we shall not be able to combat such a storm,”
wailed Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Don’t you go and follow Elizabeth Dalken’s
example of fear and cries for help,” came from
Polly who still clung to the window and watched
with fascinated eyes. But even her powers of endurance
gave way as a monster wave, crested with
such bluish, iridescent light as would have
daunted the bravest nerve, rushed up against the
plaything which Mr. Dalken believed to be proof
against all the elements.
</p>

<p>It struck the craft with a thundering blow and
at once it seemed as if pandemonium was loose.
Elizabeth yelled and screamed, other voices could
be heard shouting and screaming at the top of
good powerful seamen’s lungs, and the pounding
of water on the deck and against the door made
both girls shiver with apprehension. Polly had
let go her grasp on the brass knob when the unexpected
flood of water came up against the window,
consequently she was shunted over against
the wall beside Eleanor.
</p>

<p>Half a dozen great seas went over the craft
while Polly and Eleanor crouched against the wall
in utter despair of thinking of a way to hush the
nerve-racking screams from Elizabeth. When
the storm seemed to reach its height, and the
girls felt that they would be lost unless something
happened quick, there came a sudden and awesome
lull.
</p>

<p>“Oh, thank goodness, it is over!” sighed
Eleanor getting to her feet, and making an effort
to reach the door of her room.
</p>

<p>“Let’s get out and join the others, Nolla, because
I have heard that such sudden lulls are
merely harbingers of something worse,” advised
Polly.
</p>

<p>“There can be nothing worse than what we’ve
just passed through,” said Eleanor, with a hysterical
sound in her tones.
</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there can! Hurry into Mrs. Courtney’s
room,” said Polly, pushing her friend
quickly out of the room and over to the door of
the room where they expected to find their friend.
</p>

<p>The room was vacant. The girls stared at
each other, and Polly thought she heard voices in
Elizabeth Dalken’s room. She managed to
reach it, open it, and then, before she could say
a word, the lull was broken.
</p>

<p>Both girls were tossed like cockle shells into the
room where Mrs. Courtney was trying to soothe
Elizabeth Dalken’s nervous hysteria. At the
same time such a frightful sound of pounding
waters on the deck and sides and top of the yacht
drove apprehension deeper into their souls. Even
courageous Mrs. Courtney showed her sense of fear.
</p>

<p>“What is that noise?” whispered Eleanor in a
weak voice.
</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dear,” replied Mrs. Courtney,
“but it sounds like a cloud burst. The moment
it is over we shall be all right.”
</p>

<p>And this is what it turned out to be. A hurricane
from off shore, suddenly sweeping up gigantic
clouds of water by its sheer force of velocity
across the waves, and then suddenly emptying its
sac of water over the defenseless craft which
bravely defied the storms, endeavored to sink it.
</p>

<p>With the pouring out of its last vial of wrath
the hurricane subsided, and in half an hour all
was quiet without: all but the shouting and rushing
of the sailors as they ran to and fro on their
duties. With the four in one small room, Elizabeth
felt safer and was soon quieted. Then when
the vessel seemed to resume its untroubled course,
she settled down and fell asleep. Mrs. Courtney
and the two girls who had been hurtled into the
room, left her and closed the door softly as they
went out.
</p>

<p>“I am going to go out and see what can be
seen,” ventured Polly, but Mrs. Courtney dissuaded
her.
</p>

<p>“You may be in the way of the carrying out of
the Captain’s orders, Polly. Better remain satisfied
with going to the saloon. I expect to find
all the others there before us.”
</p>

<p>Thence the three made their way, and true to
predictions, the grown-ups were assembled there
talking over the narrow escape they had just had.
</p>

<p>“What time is it?” asked Eleanor of Tom
Latimer.
</p>

<p>“It must be near dawn,” added Polly, anxiously.
</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t,” replied Tom, as he took out his
watch. “I had not yet taken off my coat and vest
when this storm came upon us. I rushed out of
my room at the first blow and offered my services
to the Captain, but he had prepared, thank God!
We wouldn’t be talking over events now had he
not understood the forecast of the weather.”
</p>

<p>Tom showed the two girls his watch and to
their surprise they realized that all had happened
in less than twenty minutes. It was but just one
o’clock.
</p>

<p>“Then we ought to get back to bed and coax
our beauty sleep to soothe our nerves,” laughed
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“So we shall, as soon as Shink sends in our hot
malted milk. He claims it will soothe any
nerves—the way he can concoct it. I ordered him to
prepare a cauldronful for the crew, too, as they
needed calming more than any one I ever saw.
Not from fear or nerves, but from doing the work
of ten times their number in order to keep us
afloat.” Mr. Dalken seemed seriously thoughtful
for a moment after he spoke, then he added:
</p>

<p>“I am the only one here who realizes the close
call we had. The Captain with his preventive
measures before the storm broke, and the ready
obedience of his crew, saved us this night. Not
only did we run foul of one of the fiercest hurricanes
that sweep over the sea at this latitude, but
we also managed to get under the deluge that
broke when the hurricane began to lose power and
let go its hold on the great mass of water it managed
to hold aloft during its swift circling about
our poor little craft.
</p>

<p>“Thank God for that Swedish lad! Had it not
been for his powerful muscle in the moment of
extremity, we would now be without a Captain.
It all happened so suddenly that no one had time
to think. The sudden cloud burst, or water spout,
fell just as Captain Blake started to cross the
deck, and the volume of water would have carried
him overboard but for that young giant. Instead
of thinking he acted. He threw an arm
about the brass bar and caught hold of the Captain’s
arm as he was washed past him. With a
grip like steel the rescuer managed to work his
way, hand over hand clutching to the water-washed
rail, until he had reached safety.
</p>

<p>“Well, such is the life of a sea-faring man!”
concluded Mr. Dalken, as he sat and thought of
the past danger.
</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chV'>CHAPTER V—TOUCHING AT PALM BEACH</h1>

<p>Before the White Crest reached her first port,
which was Jacksonville, Mr. Dalken must have regretted
his invitation to his daughter Elizabeth to
become one of his party for the cruise. She had
not only taken every occasion to contradict her
father when he made any statement, but she
sneered at all he said. Naturally this superior
air from a young girl deeply annoyed Polly and
Eleanor who were Mr. Dalken’s sworn allies; and
the friends who knew and admired their host
without limitation, also felt diffident at such times
as Mr. Dalken was so rudely criticised.
</p>

<p>Said Eleanor to Polly one night before retiring:
“If I were Dalky I’d take Elizabeth to the
express train going to New York and I’d ship
her home to her butterfly mother!”
</p>

<p>“It’s one thing to say such a thing, but quite
another matter to accomplish it,” returned Polly.
</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we may find some way in which
to leave her behind when we touch at Jacksonville
or Palm Beach.”
</p>

<p>“Oh! Are we going to stop at Palm Beach?”
exclaimed Polly.
</p>

<p>“Why, yes! Didn’t you know? It was Elizabeth’s
coaxing that caused Dalky to agree to stop
over there to have dinner at the Ponce de Leon.
Perhaps we shall spend the evening there and return
to the ship to sleep.”
</p>

<p>“That’s great! If Elizabeth should meet any
of her New York friends at the hotel she may
prefer to remain,” ventured Polly.
</p>

<p>“I’m hoping the same thing. If only we could
hypnotize people we might bring some one she
likes right into her pathway,” laughed Eleanor
as she jumped into bed.
</p>

<p>The following morning the yacht reached Jacksonville
where Tom Latimer was supposed to
leave his friends and start back North. But John
and Anne Brewster were persuaded to remain on
board with their friends till they reached Palm
Beach, hence Tom decided to remain too, and
thence accompany his bosom friend John back to
New York.
</p>

<p>“If Tom insists upon dogging my every step
as he has been doing on the yacht, I don’t see that
I am going to have a good time,” pouted Polly,
as she heard Eleanor’s news that Tom would go
on to Palm Beach.
</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed teasingly. “That’s what a
young girl gets for having a beau who is daffy
over her!”
</p>

<p>“But, Nolla,” complained Polly, “it isn’t my
fault that Tom won’t take a broad hint to mind
his own business!”
</p>

<p>“Perhaps he thinks this <span class='it'>is</span> his business—the
business of getting the girl he has made up his
mind to marry,” declared Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Well, then! You can just tell him from me,
Nolla, that he is going about it in exactly the
wrong way to interest me in himself. A girl hates
to be tagged, just as a man loses interest in a girl
who is forever putting herself in his way to be
noticed.”
</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him!” agreed Eleanor, laughingly.
</p>

<p>But it was not necessary that Eleanor warn
Tom of his over-zealous attentions to Polly, because
a general surprise awaited the mariners
when the vessel docked. Not only did Eleanor
find a telegram from her father, in which he said
that unexpected trouble at his bank kept him in
Chicago, and prevented his joining the happy
friends on the White Crest, but Mr. Dalken also
found his ward, John Baxter, and his friend Raymond
Ames waiting to come aboard. Every one
believed Jack to be in New York.
</p>

<p>“Well, well, boys, where did you hail from?”
was Mr. Dalken’s first words as the two young
men leaped upon the deck and ran to present
themselves.
</p>

<p>“Why, immediately after you sailed I met my
friend Ray who was bound for a position in
Panama. Being so lonesome with all you friends
away, it took but little coaxing from him to persuade
me to accompany him,” explained Jack.
</p>

<p>Even while the new-comers were being overwhelmed
with questions from the mariners, Mr.
Dalken called a hasty council of war and discussed
the advisability of going ashore to see the town,
or to continue on to Palm Beach. It was unanimously
decided that Jacksonville contained nothing
of interest to the sailors, the three guests just
arrived, having seen all they wanted to see at the
city. Hence orders were given to pull up anchor
and sail away to the famous winter resort
where all and sundry kinds of sport might be
found.
</p>

<p>With the coming of Jack and Ray on board
the yacht, the girls showed more life and interest
in planning to pass the time. Tom felt so much
the senior of the two young men who now vied
with him for Polly’s smiles, that he joined his
chum John Brewster, and held aloof from the
younger members in the party. Not till Anne reminded
him that he was acting the same mistaken
part he had played on board the ocean liner at
the time it docked at Quarantine in New York
City, did he rouse himself to look pleasant and
agreeable when Polly danced and laughed with the
friends of her own age.
</p>

<p>The small damage done the yacht in the hurricane,
which she had braved and came out of the
victor, was soon attended to by one of the mates
who had been a ship’s carpenter before Mr. Dalken’s
alluring salary had tempted him to join up
on Captain Blake’s crew. Long before the
White Crest arrived at Palm Beach the repairs
had all been done and the craft was looking as
pert and fresh as any millionaire’s vessel within a
radius of twenty miles of the Beach.
</p>

<p>Of all the merry-makers in that party of mariners
not one cared very much what food was
served for dinner at the Ponce de Leon, but every
one did take a personal interest in the groups of
young people, the life of society at that gay season
in Palm Beach, and the fun they expected to get
out of the visit to the fashionable hotel and the
evening hours spent on shore.
</p>

<p>Eleanor had hinted to Polly that it might be
possible that Elizabeth Dalken would find a number
of society friends from New York at the hotel,
and so she did.
</p>

<p>Naturally they came buzzing about her, and, to
impress her yachting associates with her social
prestige, she smiled sweetly upon the trio, and accepted
their invitation to go with them. Elizabeth
did not deem it necessary to ask her father’s consent
to leave his party and attach herself to that
of her newly-found friends from New York;
neither did she hesitate to go with them minus
a proper chaperone, although she had seemed
very particular about criticising other girls who
may have overlooked Mrs. Grundy at times.
</p>

<p>As Mr. Dalken was not present in the group
when Elizabeth took French leave, and Mrs.
Courtney was not asked about a chaperone for
that evening, the girl hurried away to enjoy herself
as she saw best. Mr. Dalken, returning soon
after her departure, seemed amazed that she had
gone, but he said nothing at the time and immediately
turned his full attention to the entertainment
of his guests.
</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor had insisted that the
younger members in the party dress in their very
best. This called for Mrs. Courtney and her
elderly friends to dress up to the standard set by
the girls. And this, naturally, compelled the men
to give more attention to their evening clothes and
general appearances than they might have done
without this spur from the ladies. Hence it happened
that not a single unit of gay persons at
dinner that night in the magnificent hotel could
surpass the appearances of Mr. Dalken’s party.
As he remarked later:
</p>

<p>“It was to be expected of such an extraordinary
bouquet of beautiful females as I conducted from
my yacht. Others might have shown costlier
jewels and handsomer gowns but not one could
compete with my flowers where beauty was the
test.”
</p>

<p>As it mattered little at what hour the passengers
went back to the yacht, they made the most
of this gay evening on shore. John and Anne
Brewster were to leave the party the next day and
start back to New York for a week before
returning to Pebbly Pit Ranch. And Tom Latimer,
now that Polly expected to be away from New
York for many months, felt inclined to accompany
his friends back to his work at Choko
Mines. Perhaps it was his salvation that Polly
decided to take this cruise, otherwise he may
never have found courage or inclination enough to
go back to his mining interests.
</p>

<p>Having danced herself breathless, Polly finally
consented to hear Anne’s whispered suggestion
that she leave a few moments to Tom before he
got mad and walked back home. With a little
laugh Polly sent Jack Baxter a sorry look and
told him to go find Elizabeth for a dancing
partner.
</p>

<p>“But I’d rather dance with you, Polly. What
is Mrs. Brewster saying to you that makes you
look so remorseful?” replied he.
</p>

<p>“I’m telling Polly of a very urgent duty, Jack,
and you know, as well as I, that you must not
monopolize <span class='it'>all</span> her time this evening,” retorted
Anne.
</p>

<p>“Well, seeing that I am going to be one of the
passengers on Dalky’s yacht for a long time, I believe
I <span class='it'>will</span> release Polly to Tom for a short
time,” remarked Jack in a casual tone.
</p>

<p>“Oh! You are not really going on the yacht,
are you?” exclaimed Polly.
</p>

<p>“Why? Do you object to my company?” demanded
Jack.
</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It will be lots livelier with Ray and
you on board. But no one has mentioned it before,
so I naturally thought you and Ray were
here for a short visit at the Beach, then planned
to go back to New York to continue your studies,”
explained Polly.
</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Jack in a thoughtful
manner, “I’ve convinced Dalky that the great
mining interests of the Argentine need my personal
investigation. You must not forget that a
great deal of my fortune is invested in mining
shares in South America; and these mining companies
have their central offices at Buenos Aires.
Dalky can tell you that a visit to these brokers,
now and then, makes them sit up and take notice
of you. Otherwise they might ignore your dividends,
you see.”
</p>

<p>Anne jeered at such an explanation for Jack’s
hurried decision to visit South America. “I can
safely vouch for your remaining in the United
States, were it not for the fact that you find a
bevy of pretty girls on your guardian’s yacht too
alluring for you to renounce. You plan to get the
most fun out of this cruise and then go your way,
leaving a string of broken hearts behind you.
That is the reputation you have, I find.” Anne
laughed as she shook a finger at Jack.
</p>

<p>“My reputation for drawing and then breaking
hearts can never reach the championship winner
and breaker that Polly is. Who can ever ignore
that European tour when the subject of hearts is
being discussed?” Jack shook his head in pretended
sorrow for those rejected suitors on the
“Other Side.”
</p>

<p>Polly made an impatient sound with the tip of
her tongue against her white little teeth, and Jack
laughed.
</p>

<p>“Just for that I am going without a single word
of regret for the dances I promised you and now
withhold,” said Polly, turning and running away
to join the group sitting under a great palm on
the balcony.
</p>

<p>Here she found Tom moodily talking with
John. But the moment Polly touched him on the
shoulder and said: “Are we going for a little
walk on the beach?” he brightened up wonderfully.
</p>

<p>Polly felt that she owed Tom this short time
before he would have to return west on his mining
work. Also she felt that she had treated him too
sternly in punishment of his short-comings. Of
course, Tom had no idea that Polly considered
his slavish attentions as short-comings.
</p>

<p>As the two sauntered away from the hotel and
turned in the direction of the marvellous beach,
Polly began the conversation by remarking, in a
cool, mature manner: “Now don’t go and talk of
bosh, Tom, just because I invited you for a
stroll.”
</p>

<p>“What do you mean by bosh?” demanded
Tom, ready with a chip on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>“Oh, pooh! You know what I mean—your
soft talk of love. I just won’t listen to it morning,
and night, and at every moment of the day.
You are the dandiest pal with Nolla and Ruth and
Nancy—why not with me?”
</p>

<p>Tom wisely held his peace. He could have answered
in his own way, but he knew that would
call forth a new tirade against his ideas of possession.
Not having a reply from her escort with
which to continue the argument, Polly found herself
shut up on the subject. And wisely she, too,
launched out upon an entirely opposite topic.
</p>

<p>“Some one told Dalky not to stop at Hayti
because the natives were so treacherous to white
folks,” remarked Polly. “I did so want to see
the Island we hear so much about. I’ve read of
the voodoo religion, and the way the sacred snake
charmers strike terror into the souls of their congregations,
and I’d love to see them.”
</p>

<p>“I think Dalken is absolutely right in not taking
chances with you girls in landing at Hayti.
Morally the Haytians are not to be trusted. All
the old superstitions of barbaric Africa prevail to
such an extent that no right-minded person wishes
to visit there. I am surprised, Polly, that you
can entertain the least desire to see what every
one knows to be a deplorable condition of affairs.”
Tom spoke in a fatherly way that caused
Polly to smile, but he did not see her face. Perhaps
he would not have continued in the same
strain had he thought she was amused instead of
being advised.
</p>

<p>“Yes, Hayti is an unsafe place for civilized
women to go to; not only do the authorities ignore
the rights of a people under their government, but
they seem to have no regard for human lives. I
recently read an article in a magazine in which it
stated that one unfortunate circumstance about
Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, was its
convenience to Hayti—all the escaping criminals and
refugees from justice jumped aboard a sailing
craft and in a few hours were landed upon the
shores of that beautiful isle whence they could not
be taken except through extradition papers.”
</p>

<p>“How intensely thrilling to me is all this political
information. I’m sure I shall never wish to
see a voodoo service after hearing you speak of
government and politics,” laughed Polly.
</p>

<p>Tom now turned and stared at the girl. Was
she in earnest about saying she cared nothing for
Hayti now, or was she ridiculing his advices? To
keep her companion in doubt as to her motive,
Polly changed the subject again.
</p>

<p>“I shall delight in visiting Jamaica, and Porto
Rico, perhaps the Barbados, before we go
through the Panama Canal. Dalky says that,
should it be impossible for a stop at the Barbados
on our way down to South America, he will
see that the Captain surely stops there on our return.
Have you any warnings to give concerning
the natives of the Caribbean Isles?”
</p>

<p>“I don’t know a thing about them! I never
visited Hayti, you know, but I merely told you
what learned and wise men say of it.” Tom’s
tone was not very sweet, and Polly realized that
her last words had offended his sensitive heart.
</p>

<p>“Let’s talk of Pebbly Pit and Choko’s Mine,”
said she with forced joyous anticipation in her
voice. She felt sure she knew all that Tom would
say in order to prove to her that she ought to
marry him and live out on the ranch with her
family. This time Tom disappointed her, however.
</p>

<p>“I have nothing new to tell you about Pebbly
Pit, because you know as well as I do that I have
been in New York too long to be able to speak
of what may be taking place out on the ranch.
But one thing I can speak of, and even that is not
yours or my business, I suppose, and that is the
queer triangle on board the White Crest—do you
get me?”
</p>

<p>“A triangle! No, I do not get you, Tom.
What is it?”
</p>

<p>“Well, then, I know just as well as if you had
told me, that Nolla and you are match-making between
Dalky and Mrs. Courtney. And I might
add, that I can advise you to watch your step, but
of course, you will throw back your head and give
me a glance of disdain, hence I will not warn you.
This much I can say, nevertheless, and that is:
Look out for Elizabeth Dalken, if you think
Nolla and you can pull little Cupid’s bow and
arrows to suit yourselves. You’ve got the third
angle of the proposition when you have Elizabeth
with whom to reckon. She is worldly wise and
she won’t hesitate to use every bit of knowledge
she possesses to thwart such a scheme for her
father.”
</p>

<p>Polly looked serious. “Did you really guess
that much? How did you do it, when Nolla and
I have been models of discretion? Not even
Dalky or Mrs. Courtney, or the Fabians dream
of the match.”
</p>

<p>“Maybe it is because I am so miserably in love
myself, that I intuitively feel for any one else who
may be in the same boat.”
</p>

<p>Tom’s tone and hopeless manner caused Polly
intense amusement though she managed to hide
the fact from him. However, she was in earnest
now, regarding this matter about the matchmaking,
and she wanted to get Tom’s valuable
suggestions on the matter.
</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Tom to her anxious questioning,
“one always gets into hot water when matchmaking
between two persons, especially if those
two have had a taste of matrimonial troubles.
But I know Nolla and you well enough to see
that you will not give up a pet plan until you are
driven to desperation over its failure. With
Elizabeth Dalken to frustrate every tête-à-tête, or
other plans to throw these two mature hoped-for
lovers together, what will you do? Either
come out boldly and show your cards, or call that
girl’s bluff, or in some way be the means of shipping
her back home.”
</p>

<p>“Well, how can we call her bluff when she won’t
admit us to her confidence?” asked Polly, eagerly.
</p>

<p>“Watch opportunities! But it will be easier to
ship her back home, if you can get her deeply interested
in an objective in going north and allowing
you-all to continue your voyage.”
</p>

<p>“Show me the objective and I’ll do it! She’s
getting on everybody’s nerves, as it is. And I
verily believe that Dalky is heartily sorry he had
her come,” declared Polly.
</p>

<p>“One objective would be to induce her to remain
at Palm Beach, now that she is here with
friends, and get her father to give her a sufficient
inducement in cash to tear herself away from the
yacht and the prospective voyage. Another
objective might be Jack Baxter. She knows he is
enormously wealthy, and it is her sole aim and ambition
to marry a fortune and a good family
name. She would get both in Baxter, but I doubt
if Jack would fall for her. However, if he could
be induced to pose as a cavalier, and cut short his
trip to South America, I’m sure the girl would
follow—providing she had a satisfactory chaperone
to give the entire proceeding Mother
Grundy’s approval.”
</p>

<p>Polly frowned down both of the propositions.
“She won’t remain at Palm Beach because she has
been here too often to have it afford her any novelty
now. On the other hand we can’t expect Jack
Baxter to place his head upon the block for execution,
just to please us in ridding ourselves of
the girl. Why, Elizabeth might claim Jack as a
suitor, and then drive poor Jack to desperate steps
in order to show he is a gentleman!”
</p>

<p>While they were discussing such weighty matters
the two had turned and were walking back
again in the direction of the hotel. Neither one
had seen the moonlight on the sea, nor had they
realized that they had strolled across the hard
beach and back again—so full of plans were they
over the little plot for happiness for their two
good friends. Now they came to the Palm Walk
again.
</p>

<p>“Where <span class='it'>have</span> you two been?” demanded
Eleanor, impatiently.
</p>

<p>“We’ve spent half an hour looking for you.
Dalky wants us to find Elizabeth and start back
for the yacht,” added Nancy Fabian.
</p>

<p>“We will have no trouble in starting for the
yacht, but to find Elizabeth is quite a different
matter,” laughed Tom.
</p>

<p>John Brewster now came over to Tom and
spoke. “Anne and I are going to pack our bags
and come back on shore to-night, as Dalken says
the Captain wishes to resume the voyage early
in the morning. I thought you would want to
get your bag, too, and come back with us. If you
prefer remaining here, Anne says she can pack the
suitcase and spare you the trip.”
</p>

<p>“No, thank you! I’ll go with you and see as
much of Polly as I can, before leaving her to sail
away with no certain future for me in it!” exclaimed
Tom, positively. John smiled.
</p>

<p>The bell-boys having sought about quickly in
every direction of the hotel and gardens returned,
one by one, with the reply that Miss Elizabeth
Dalken failed to respond to their calls. Mr. Dalken
tipped each page as he reported to him, and
then turned to his friends. “There’s nothing for
it, but that I hunt her up myself, and permit you
to go on to the yacht alone. I’ll come as soon
as I locate my daughter.”
</p>

<p>Polly caught a sympathetic glance from Mrs.
Courtney’s eye in the direction of the troubled
host, then the guests accepted the inevitable and
left the man to seek Elizabeth in every niche and
corner of the vast resort.
</p>

<p>As the group of guests from the White Crest
got near to the wharf where they had left the
yacht, they were astonished to see the craft gone.
They looked at each other and then all around to
reassure themselves that they were not dreaming.
A young colored night watchman on the dock saw
the wondering expressions on their faces and
spoke up.
</p>

<p>“You-all a-lookin’ foh dat white yacht from
Noo Yoork?”
</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy; what can you tell us about it?”
asked Mr. Ashby.
</p>

<p>“Why, not much; onny, ’bout a nour ago, ’long
comes a fine pert missy wid a lot of swells, an’ dey
gits on bo’hd. Den de skippeh what was lef to
watch the boat, comes off a’fumin’ mad, an’ says
he’s goin’ to see ’bout dat! I heah’s him say
somefin not werry nice to free er four dudes lef’
on deck, but dey laffs and waves a han’, so off he
goes threatenin’ to get the boss on de job to onct!
Fust ting I knows, the yacht up and sails away.
I watches, ’cuz I got a stay on dis dock till
mawnin’ and keep an eye on decency, an’ sure
’nuff, dat boat goes dancing off down coast. Lots
of likker at a certain port dere, yuh see, and swells
heah takes a trip down ebery onct in a while.”
</p>

<p>“And you haven’t seen a sign of the yacht since
then?” demanded Mr. Ashby, red hectic spots
suddenly coming to his cheeks as symbols of his
ire at such high-handed treatment of his friend.
</p>

<p>“Beggin’ yur pawdon, suh, but I knows two of
dem dudes, an’ I doubts if dey kin sail that yacht
back straight to-night, if dey gets what dey sets
out foh gittin. F’om all I heah said, dey went foh
jus’ such a time.”
</p>

<p>At this disturbing information, Mr. Ashby
joined the negro for a moment and at his
advice, turned and said: “Fabian, I’m going back
for Dalken, but what had you-all better do
meantime?” Mr. Ashby seemed anxious to meet his
friend before he should come to the dock and
learn the news from others.
</p>

<p>“We will wait here for orders. The yacht may
come in while you are gone, and in that case we
will try to straighten out matters, and see that
Elizabeth’s friends get quickly out of the way of
her father’s righteous indignation.”
</p>

<p>The moment Mr. Ashby left, Mrs. Courtney
went over to the mulatto youth and spoke in a
low voice. He replied in a tone too low to be
heard by any one but the lady with him. Then
she slipped him some money and returned to her
own party.
</p>

<p>“I learned that no older woman was in the
party with Elizabeth, but a young divorcee and the
several men who seemed past forty. I had judged
from Elizabeth’s uncompromising attitude to us
in our disregard to little matters concerning dinner
dress and social nothings, that she would have
been most strict and careful in such a delicate
situation as this which she has brought about.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Ashby had secured the names of the ports
where those with enough money might secure
liquor in spite of the dry laws, and it was his plan
to hire the fastest car to be had and drive Dalken
along the shore until they found the yacht and the
runaways.
</p>

<p>In telling the story to his friend, Mr. Ashby
purposely shielded Elizabeth by making it appear
that she was misled by her friends. But Mr. Dalken
was not to be hoodwinked. He was an experienced
man of the world, and he understood
present-day flapperdom perfectly.
</p>

<p>“Why take an automobile when we might get
a launch and go on their track? I’m sure the
launch would prove best, and it may be possible to
find a large enough power launch to accommodate
our party. Then we need not return to this hateful
place. We can ship back the society cads in
the launch and go on our way as planned.” Mr.
Dalken seemed to consider the case with more
coolness and sense than his friend had done.
</p>

<p>“What about John and Anne and Tom? They
expected to go ashore here, after getting their
bags. And how about the crew?”
</p>

<p>“John and Anne and Tom can leave us at
Miami as well as at Palm Beach. As for the
crew; the Captain’s orders were for every man
to be on hand at the yacht at twelve. It is now
past the time, and doubtless they will be waiting
on the dock,” explained Mr. Dalken, having
looked at his watch and then slipped it back into
his pocket.
</p>

<p>As predicted, the crew were all at the dock,
standing in small groups; the Captain stood with
Mr. Fabian, wondering what would be the outcome
of this escapade. Mr. Dalken seemed perfectly
cool and self-possessed as he called to the
Captain.
</p>

<p>“Get a craft at once—large enough to take us
all. You understand, Captain Blake, that price
is nothing now!”
</p>

<p>The same negro youth, who had been the informer
in the first place, now spoke up. “I knows
whar you-all kin hire a fine big gaserline launch—my
boss rents it out ebery day. I kin sen’ yuh
dere.”
</p>

<p>Giving Captain Blake minute directions to
find the boat which was not far off, the negro
gladly pocketed another windfall of money from
the owner of the White Crest.
</p>

<p>In less than twenty minutes the launch came
alongside the wharf and its owner stepped out.
“It’s the quickest and safest boat in Florida.
Many’s the trip I takes to Havana during the
season.”
</p>

<p>Thus the weary party gladly got into the
launch, and its owner started on the way to seek
for and find the White Crest.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI—MR. DALKEN’S PATERNAL TRAINING</h1>

<p>Conversing pleasantly, and smoking one cigar
after another, Mr. Dalken offered no cause for
one to think he was boiling within, or that he was
contemplating a severe correction for his daughter
Elizabeth. But Mr. Ashby knew him so well that
he would have felt more at ease had his friend
expressed a little impatience and annoyance at the
unexpected trick played by the girl.
</p>

<p>The men in the party sat with the owner who
drove the great launch through the calm waters,
but ever and anon he swerved suddenly to avoid,
as he said, reefs of coral hidden by the wavelets.
He skirted the coast because they needed to keep
a watchful lookout for the yacht which might
have anchored at one of the many tiny inlets along
the shore, where bootleggers thrived during the
great social season in the South.
</p>

<p>The yacht’s crew sat in the stern of the boat,
but the ladies were comfortably at rest in the
small saloon. There was but one absorbing
thought and subject for them: what would be
Elizabeth’s punishment when her father could
judge her heedless act?
</p>

<p>After stopping at several small ports, where it
seemed likely they would find the White Crest
at anchor with other crafts from the winter resorts,
the owner of the launch remarked to Captain
Blake:
</p>

<p>“If they went to Satan’s Kitchen, they must’a
had some wise birds along. Only the old hands
dare go there and get their drinks. And the stuff
is rank pizen, at that! Nuthin’ but liquid fire.
Two or three young fools got knocked out by taking
this bootlegger’s vile whiskey, and one feller
cashed in his checks.”
</p>

<p>The Captain made no reply, but it was not
necessary.
</p>

<p>“Satan’s Kitchen is a coupla miles in an inlet
what dips in from the shore line at Delray. We
won’t be able to see the yacht from outside, but
that’s whar we’re bound to find the runaways, I’m
thinking.”
</p>

<p>“All right—drive in and we’ll soon know,”
ordered Mr. Dalken, taking command for the
first time since leaving Palm Beach.
</p>

<p>Shortly after this the launch made a graceful
curve and chugged carefully through shallow
waters until it came to the narrow inlet mentioned
by the captain of the boat. Having gone a very
short distance inside this inlet, those on deck soon
saw the White Crest anchored near a strip of
glistening sandy beach. A rough pier of old
planks ran out to the deep water in order to accommodate
those who wished to land. Here the
launch stopped.
</p>

<p>“No, take us to the yacht. I wish to see my
guests safely on board my own boat, and the crew
in their places. Then if the other party is still
on shore you may carry me back to this pier,”
commanded Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>Without any confusion or other sound than the
subdued chug of the engine of the launch, the
transfer of the party was made. Only the few
sailors who had been left on the yacht that evening
were found on board, so Mr. Dalken got
back into the launch and was about to start for
the pier when Mrs. Courtney urged Mr. Ashby to
go with him.
</p>

<p>“You see, no one can tell what may happen in
such a place as this Satan’s Kitchen. Dalky is
cool now, but what may he be should he find cause
for chastising the men who dared to plan this
runaway?”
</p>

<p>Therefore, without asking his friend’s consent,
Mr. Ashby jumped back into the launch and the
boat started away. Those left on board the yacht
learned that the Captain had orders to start out
at once, and wait about half a mile off the shore.
The launch would pick up the yacht there and
transfer the owner and his friend.
</p>

<p>To the anxious group of friends on the yacht it
seemed that a long time had elapsed before they
could hear the chugging of the returning launch,
but in reality it was hardly half an hour from the
time that Mr. Dalken and his friend Ashby had
left the White Crest before they returned. Elizabeth
Dalken was with them, but not a sign of any
one of her companions on the recent excursion
was to be seen.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth, in moody silence, ran up the steps
and went directly to her room. Mr. Dalken paid
the owner of the launch and said in a tone that
carried its own pointed meaning: “You comprehend
that I am paying you for the hire of this
craft until noon to-morrow?”
</p>

<div class='wx400 imgcenter'>

<p class='caption wx400'>ELIZABETH, IN MOODY SILENCE, RAN UP THE STEPS.</p>
</div>

<p>“I get you, Boss,” returned the man, bowing
seriously. “Anyway, even if you were not so
generous in your pay, I have no likings for such
passengers who know better but act like sots.”
</p>

<p>“All right. Start back for Palm Beach. I’ll
follow in your wake.” So saying Mr. Dalken
stepped aboard his own craft and waved the
owner of the launch to proceed northward on his
return trip.
</p>

<p>Mr. Ashby said not a word of explanation to
the curious friends waiting on deck, but Mr. Dalken
spoke freely as if they were entitled to the
story.
</p>

<p>“We found just about the sort of scene as I
expected to see at that den. Those men in the
party, easily ten years my senior, only used the
hare-brained divorcee and the younger girls as a
means to obtain their end—that of running my
yacht to the place where they knew they could get
all the vile liquor they craved. Once there, they
never gave a thought as to how their companions
might fare. Hence I took my girl and left them
to work it out as they saw best. There is no
trolley or other transportation method of leaving
the place, other than by boat or automobile, and
of the latter there was none to be hired. I may
have been a bit severe on the other young women
in the party, but they should have taken all
favorable conditions into consideration before
they consented to run away with another man’s
valuable property, in order to satisfy an abnormal
curiosity about a notorious locality. I am thankful
to say that I have saved <span class='it'>my</span> property from the
scandal which would be sure to follow on the heels
of a scrape such as those men I saw at Satan’s
Kitchen are certain to rouse at one of their orgies.
Now, however, it will be necessary for me
to return to Palm Beach and prove that my yacht
and my friends were anchored at the wharf till
morning, and that Elizabeth and I were at the
hotel at the dance.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken excused himself after concluding
his explanation, and went to his daughter’s room
to escort her to the hotel.
</p>

<p>The interested colored man who had given Mr.
Dalken the valuable information regarding the
men who had taken possession of the White
Crest without the owner’s consent or knowledge,
now watched curiously as Mr. Dalken and his
daughter left the craft and walked in the direction
of the hotel.
</p>

<p>The crowds were already thinning out on the
ball-room floor, but enough representatives of society
still remained to dance to the last note of
the orchestra. As fortune had it, one of Mr.
Dalken’s well-known friends and his family was
present and saw the financier as soon as he stepped
upon the floor to dance with Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>“There’s Dalken and his daughter—remember
we had him to dinner in Washington when I first
took my Seat?” whispered the gentleman to his
wife.
</p>

<p>A reporter for a New York paper stood near
and overheard the remark. Instantly he made a
note of it and drew nearer to his source of information.
He heard the Representative speak
of the White Crest and the cruise, and he decided
to look up the yacht and its owner in the morning.
</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken between Mr. Dalken
and his daughter after they left the hotel and
boarded the yacht. No one was in sight on deck
and the owner accompanied Elizabeth to her room
and went in behind her. Then he closed the door
and turned to have a word with her.
</p>

<p>He spoke tenderly at first, but she ignored him
completely and refused to answer his questions.
Finally he said sternly: “Elizabeth, I wish you
to answer my questions in regard to this escapade.”
</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care if you do! I do not have
to speak to you unless I wish to!” snapped she.
</p>

<p>“I am your father, and I represent your guardian
in the law. I am responsible, to a certain extent,
for all your wrong-doings, hence I demand
that you tell me how you came to go to that vile
den where I found you with those despicable
men.”
</p>

<p>Elizabeth stared defiantly at her father, then
she remarked: “You may demand, but I do not
need to reply.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken then tried to show her what a risk
she had taken in going to a place where a murder
or other crime was apt to happen at any moment
if one of the habitues became too drunk to control
himself.
</p>

<p>Elizabeth narrowed her eyelids and looked at
her father in a manner that reminded him unpleasantly
of her mother whenever she had been
cornered in a scandalous situation. Then the girl
spoke drawlingly.
</p>

<p>“You are such a fossil when it comes to social
matters! Why, there isn’t a girl I know who
would not give her head to have been in my shoes
to-night. But how can you know that two of those
men are the finest catches of the season. Henri
Aspinwall is a multi-millionaire from South
America, and James Stickney is one from New York.
I had both of them at my feet this evening, and
then you came to ruin my prospects of a proposal!”
Elizabeth actually wept tears of mortification
at her father’s untimely appearance in
Satan’s Kitchen.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken gasped in sheer unbelief. “Do you
mean to say you <span class='it'>knew</span> those two men? Did you
know they were divorced by their wives for their
disreputable living?”
</p>

<p>“How silly you are! Reputations are nothing
in these liberal times, because divorce is so convenient.
Those two men have money and the
most charming personalities. That is why their
wives can’t live with them—they are generally so
shabby looking and are fiercely jealous of the attentions
paid their husbands by appreciative
women. Naturally, men like Henri or James are
too popular for their fogy wives, hence the divorces,
you know!”
</p>

<p>“Why, Elizabeth, you are positively shocking!
I cannot believe you are not yet twenty and my
own child! Where have you acquired all this
nightmare of experience in such things?” Mr.
Dalken’s voice trembled with emotion over the
girl’s short-comings.
</p>

<p>“Really, father, one might think <span class='it'>you</span> were a
saint, from the way you are trying to preach to
me!” sneered Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to pose as a saint, but at
least I know I am a clean-minded man, and I demand
that my daughter act as a young lady
should, while she is in my charge,” was Mr. Dalken’s
stern reply.
</p>

<p>“I suppose you would invite me to model my
behavior after such country clods as Miss Brewster,
or take for my example such flippant nobodies
as Eleanor Maynard from Chicago?”
scorned Elizabeth, tossing her head. “Why, I
knew them both at school in New York, and I
must say that not a girl in society would deign to
cast a glance at either of them now. They are
absolutely too impossible to stand on any rung of
the social ladder, and not even the commonest
plane of society in New York would consider
them.”
</p>

<p>“I am ashamed to hear you say so. It goes to
prove how low the social standard has fallen. In
fact, I may add, that the standard of a once decent
period must have been dragged through the
mire, of late times, to present such views as you
entertain as its highest aspirations.” Mr.
Dalken’s words were cutting and Elizabeth resented
them.
</p>

<p>“Well, I am sorry to remind you, sir, that men
who can shamelessly turn their backs upon the
obligations of a wife and daughter and go after
such women as you prefer to call your friends, are
the very ones who smirch society’s fair standard
and then stand up and denounce it as having
fallen.”
</p>

<p>Sheer astonishment and shocked soul of Mr.
Dalken kept him silent after Elizabeth concluded
her statement. Finding he failed to reply, she
added sarcastically:
</p>

<p>“If my dear mother but knew the type of
woman she might have to call her successor to
such marital felicity as you deprived <span class='it'>her</span> of when
she called herself Mrs. Dalken, she would not
concern herself to save you from such a degradation!”
</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Dalken found his powers of speech.
“What under the sun are you driving at, you little
vixen!”
</p>

<p>Elizabeth tossed her head and laughed a harsh,
cold laugh. “How innocent we are, eh, Dad? To
hear you <span class='it'>now</span>, and to see you with Mrs. Courtney
when others are about one would say you two
were not enjoying the tête-à-têtes she so wisely
plans for you. But how can one expect anything
otherwise? You left mother in order to live your
life of selfish pleasure, and this woman turned her
back on her husband and her own country, because
she could no longer appear in decent society
in London, and now it seems quite natural for you
two to find mutual consolation in the companionship
of each other. Poor Mamma!”
</p>

<p>As Elizabeth spoke, Mr. Dalken got upon his
feet and stood with head held high. The moment
she had concluded, she glanced spitefully up at
him, but his expression cowed her for a moment.
When he found his voice he said coldly, but with
dire meaning for the girl:
</p>

<p>“You will see to it that your luggage is ready
to leave this yacht in the morning. You may
return to New York to your ‘poor mamma’ as
soon as possible, and tell her that no further allowances
are to be expected from me, and henceforth
no machinations from her will be allowed
to be tried on me. I shall call upon the law to
defend me from future attacks, both personally
and in every other way. I will bid you good-morning,
Elizabeth, and I will look for you
directly after breakfast.” With that Mr. Dalken
left the girl alone.
</p>

<p>“Well, thank heavens, he is gone!” grumbled
Elizabeth to herself, as the door closed upon her
father’s heels. Then she calmly removed her
lovely gown and threw it upon the floor and suddenly
stamped upon it. Such a squall of temper
in one who, a moment before had seemed calm,
was surprising.
</p>

<p>“The nasty wasp! How I hate her sweet smile
and honeyed words. As if she could fool me with
her acting! Why, not a woman I know pretends
to be so gracious and altogether wonderful as
that horrid Courtney!” But Elizabeth failed to
take into consideration that, when one lived in
earnest, no acting could seem as real as the genuine
thing.
</p>

<p>“Well, I shall be well rid of this Sunday-school
group!” continued the girl, as she sat down and
pulled off her satin slippers and beautiful, embroidered,
silk stockings. “Once I get my things
off the yacht and am located in one of the nice
suites at the Hotel, I shall lay my plans for the
conquest of James Stickney. Oh, won’t mother
squeal with joy when she hears of my conquest!
To be Mrs. Stickney and spend his money will be
worth all the dreadful days I have had to waste
on board this boat!”
</p>

<p>Thus, as she disrobed and prepared for bed,
Elizabeth smiled even while she planned her social
campaign at Palm Beach during the time which
would elapse until she heard from her mother.
</p>

<p>But Elizabeth never dreamed of the actual plan
she would be compelled to accept on the morrow.
She had no idea that her father meant exactly
what he had said when he threatened never to contribute
more to her ease-loving support and the
monthly bills which seemed beyond all reason to
him. Hitherto he had paid all accounts without
a protest.
</p>

<p>Had she dreamed that she was to be packed off
for New York under the chaperonage of Anne
Brewster and her husband, with no opportunity to
send word to her friends at Palm Beach, and without
a dollar in her pocket with which to wire her
mother of her ignominious treatment—such it
was in her estimation—she might have tried to escape
that very night.
</p>

<p>Not long after nine o’clock in the morning,
therefore, Mr. Dalken was asked to see the reporter
and tell him such items of personal news as
would interest the readers of the New York daily.
Contrary to precedent, Mr. Dalken invited the
man to breakfast with him while he told him a
long story. How he was taking this cruise with
his intimate friends for a rest and his health.
How he had persuaded his daughter to accompany
them as far as Palm Beach, and how he
danced with her even to the last waltz at
the hotel. Then he spoke regretfully of how
she would have to return to New York that
day, as social interests could not spare her for
a continued cruise. “Oh, yes! Of course
she will be accompanied on the journey. Our very
dear friends, Mr. and Mrs. Brewster, part owners
in Choko Gold Mines, you know, are also
going North with their friend, Mr. Latimer. I
had all I could do to get these three friends to
come as far as Palm Beach with us. Now they
and my daughter cannot give us another day.”
</p>

<p>“The rumor got started in some strange way
that a party of undesirable guests at the hotel captured
your yacht and daughter and sailed away to
Satan’s Kitchen last night,” ventured the reporter.
“Did you know of the escapade, or were they back
before you found it out?”
</p>

<p>“My dear fellow! Of what <span class='it'>are</span> you speaking?
I can prove conclusively that we arrived at the
hotel in time for dinner and that we remained until
the very last dance. Why, I met an old friend
in the ball-room just as I was about to leave.
Members of my party left at different times during
the evening, but they are free to go and come
as they choose while we are on this cruise, you
know.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken was all guileless confidence with
the reporter and that worthy felt sure the report
had been started as a bit of scandal in high life.
Then his host suddenly seemed to remember an
item which might explain such a sorry story.
</p>

<p>“Perhaps that twisted version of the matter
started because we had planned to sail away after
midnight, leaving the four in my party to go back
to New York to-day. But they all remained dancing
to such an hour that it seemed absurd for
any one to pack their bags and leave the yacht at
that hour, so I advised all to sleep late and
the yacht would wait till at dawn as had been
planned.
</p>

<p>“You see, my friends heartily enjoyed the hospitality
of your magnificent hotels to such an extent
that they are all fast asleep in their rooms.
I am the only early bird on deck this morning, but
then I only danced a <span class='it'>few</span> dances with my daughter
just before the orchestra said good-night.”
</p>

<p>The reporters smiled politely and secured a few
treasured items of social interest regarding the
dances Mr. Dalken preferred, and the hour he
left the ball-room with his friends, and anything
else he might care to tell them for publication.
</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Nothing happens when
one sails on a friendly little voyage with choice
companions—that is, anything of interest to society;
because no one in my party belongs to
society and we never bother about its concerns.
But, my dear young men, I am now deeply concerned
in getting off on our cruise, and you must
really excuse me from continued conversation, unless
you care to be carried to Havana with us.”
</p>

<p>The reporters, having secured all the information
they were after, obediently bid their host
good-morning and left the yacht. Once they were
safely out of the way, Mr. Dalken had the chef
serve breakfast on deck for those who would get
up and eat.
</p>

<p>John and Anne Brewster, Tom Latimer and
Polly, and Mrs. Courtney were the only ones to
respond to the call. The former three guests
were dressed for travel, and Polly was up in
order to say a last goodby to her family members
and to Tom. Mrs. Courtney was an early riser
no matter what time she went to sleep and she
now seemed as bright and fresh as if she had had
the usual quota of sleep instead of but four hours
at the dawning of the day.
</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast Mr. Dalken gave
Anne a sealed letter and said impressively: “Now
remember, my dear Mrs. Brewster, to follow all
my instructions to the letter, whether Elizabeth
wishes it or not. She is still in my charge, even
though I appoint you a deputy to guard her till she
is placed safely in her mother’s care once more. I
do not anticipate any rebellion before she reaches
New York, but she may decide to bolt once she
finds herself on familiar ground again. However,
I made it quite plain to her last night, that
she is the arbiter of her own future if she disobeys
me in one least thing after being placed in
your care.”
</p>

<p>Thus Polly learned to her amazement that
Elizabeth was destined to leave the yacht and return
in disgrace to her mother. But the news did
not cause any regret, rather did it make her rejoice
that dear Dalky would be freed from such
a thorn in his side for the rest of the trip.
</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney maintained an inscrutable expression
that defied Polly’s reading of her
thoughts. Whether she had known of this plan
to send Elizabeth back to New York when Anne
Brewster went, or whether the news surprised her
even as it had Polly, could not be said. But
Polly met Tom’s eyes and saw a gleam of relief
there.
</p>

<p>The breakfast ended and a member of the crew
who had been despatched on shore to ascertain
exactly when the Washington Express would
leave, now came on deck and saluted. He handed
his employer a paper, and Mr. Dalken turned to
John and Tom.
</p>

<p>“The car is waiting at the end of the pier. I’ll
get my daughter and place her in your charge,
then escort you all to the automobile.”
</p>

<p>Turning to the sailor, he added: “Jim, did the
trunk get off all right?”
</p>

<p>“Yes’sa, an’ I expressed it, myself, straight
through to Noo York, sa.”
</p>

<p>“Very good. Now wait at the foot of the steps
till we come.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken went away and Polly turned to
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it will be more agreeable for
Dalky if we are not here when he comes back
with Elizabeth?”
</p>

<p>“Yes, Polly, I agree with you. We will say
our goodbys now, friends, and hurry away from
here,” replied Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>The farewells were not prolonged, therefore,
and Tom found he was short-circuited in his plans
to have a lover’s tête-à-tête with the girl he adored
so devotedly. John and Anne had their good
hugs and kisses from Polly, and then she turned
quickly to Tom and extended her hand.
</p>

<p>“Goodby, Tom, old friend. Take good care of
Anne and see that she doesn’t worry herself to a
frazzle over Elizabeth Dalken and her social
tricks.” With a hasty shake of his hand, Tom
found Polly was running away to the rear end of
the yacht where she could enter without coming
face to face with any one coming from the main
door.
</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had said her farewells and was
following Polly when Mr. Dalken came from the
door which opened to the saloon. Elizabeth was
closely veiled and dressed in a plain tailormade
suit. Without a spoken word to any one she went
directly to the stairs that led down to the wharf.
The other four adults followed her and soon all
were seated in the waiting limousine.
</p>

<p>Polly could not help peeping out from her retreat
at the back entrance to the companionway,
and when she saw the automobile drive away she
sighed with relief. “There go the two troubles
of my life—one whom I despise, and one whom
I am not sure about adoring or hating!”
</p>

<p>From this honest confession of Polly’s it can
be readily surmised that she was not head over
heels in love with Tom.
</p>

<p>In less than half an hour’s time Mr. Dalken
came on board his yacht again and immediately
gave orders to sail. Even as the Captain obeyed
and placed the distance of a rod or so between the
craft and the pier, a sprinting reporter reached
the wharf to take a snap-shot of the White Crest.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken watched him with grim satisfaction.
He then murmured to himself: “Well,
that’s all <span class='it'>you</span> got out of your run!”
</p>

<p>Later he remarked casually to Polly and Mrs.
Courtney, when they happened to be alone after
luncheon: “Our friends just caught the Express
as it was about to pull out. The conductor saw us
making for it and he very obligingly held up the
train a moment. Naturally, no one was present
to interview us about this hasty departure for the
North, and only one solitary reporter saw me returning
in the car. He failed to reach me in
time!”
</p>

<p>But their host did not add that he had used
every influence possible to insure the success of his
plan: to reach the train at the very minute of departure,
and then see his daughter off before she
could get in touch with any friends at Palm Beach.
The conductor exchanged a friendly but knowing
look with the financier as the four travelers
boarded the train, and Mr. Dalken stood watching
it pull out.
</p>

<p>“Well, children, now we’re off on the second
lap of our adventures,” laughingly called Mr.
Dalken, as he waited in vain for a remark to his
last statement. His happy tone then brought
forth glad and eager questionings as to Cuba,
Hayti, and the other Isles of the West Indies.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII—THE HAVANA RACE COURSE</h1>

<p>As the yacht danced on its way to Havana, the
voyagers began to take a renewed interest in the
cruise. At first the departure of four of the party
caused a dignified silence, particularly as Elizabeth
Dalken’s going had been brought about by
her recent disgrace and her father’s intense displeasure.
It created rather an uncomfortable
feeling when the guests all went on deck that
noon.
</p>

<p>John Baxter and his chum decided that this atmosphere
must be dispelled immediately, hence
they began their self-appointed task and soon had
every one merry and eager to forget the unpleasantness
of the previous night’s experience.
</p>

<p>Havana proved to be a great fund of excitement
and fun for the young members in the party;
John Baxter had spent several weeks in that hospitable
city and knew just where to go and what
to see, hence the day was given to every kind of
sightseeing. That evening Jack returned his
party to the yacht, and proposed another visit to
the city on the morrow. Mr. Dalken listened.
</p>

<p>“They’re going to have one of their famous
horse races at the big course to-morrow, Dalky,
and I told your guests that it would be well worth
seeing. Even if they do not bet on the horses,
they will enjoy seeing the stunts the natives do in
order to get in first. Let’s tie up to this wharf
until to-morrow night, instead of going on our
way to-night.”
</p>

<p>As the vote showed the majority were inclined
to stop over for the races, the Captain was notified
that the yacht would not resume her trip until
the next evening.
</p>

<p>That night, after dinner had been enjoyed on
deck, Mr. Dalken proposed a stroll through the
“White Light Way” of Havana. This was received
with acclaim and in another moment the
ladies were gone for their hats and light evening
wraps. Soon all were walking up the street leading
from the pier, and eagerly discussing the
change in the looks of the city by night.
</p>

<p>Half the people they met were visitors from
the States, and most of those were from New
York, or the large cities of the Atlantic coast
states. Everywhere on bill-boards, on walls of
buildings, and up high on the roofs of houses, the
advertising of the morrow’s horse racing was
posted. Now and then the men in the party
were accosted and invited to book their wagers
for the races. But Mr. Dalkin shook his head
and advised John and Ray to refuse all offers to
double and triple their gains by booking that
night.
</p>

<p>After visiting many interesting places, the
yacht-party entered a famous cafe for supper.
Dancing in all of its wildest and most sensuous
forms was demonstrated by Spanish beauties with
little idea of propriety; the very abandon of their
poses and the flashing glances they sent the American
men in the visiting parties proved how faint
were the ties that held them to respectability.
</p>

<p>“Shall we try a dance?” asked Jack Baxter of
Polly. She glanced at Mrs. Courtney with a
questioning expression.
</p>

<p>“Better not, Jack. These dancing girls and
their Spanish cavaliers are only too willing to pick
an acquaintance with any one who appears to have
money. Dancing here might prepare the way for
familiarity, for you actually descend to their plane
in taking the floor while they are on it,” advised
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“That sounds a little far-fetched, Lady Fair,
but I will abide by your commands,” laughed
Jack, though he was keen to get out on the superb
floor and dance to the inspiring music.
</p>

<p>Not five minutes later Mrs. Courtney had her
quiet little revenge on Jack for his light laugh at
her advice.
</p>

<p>Ray and Eleanor had not waited to hear Mrs.
Courtney’s hint about dancing, and had enjoyed
the waltz to the utmost till the orchestra concluded
the piece. An encore loudly continued induced
the musicians to resume the waltz. But a
handsome Spaniard approached Eleanor who was
standing with Ray at one end of the hall, and
bowing politely offered his arm to finish the dance
with her.
</p>

<p>Eleanor flushed confusedly and Ray haughtily
stared at the daring young man, then turned on
his heel and tried to escort Eleanor to her party
which was seated at one of the balcony tables.
Polly, Jack, and Mrs. Courtney were watching
the episode, and Polly murmured: “Glad I wasn’t
in Noll’s shoes! I’d have spoken my mind to the
fellow.”
</p>

<p>No sooner had Eleanor found her friends than
Mrs. Courtney got up and said: “Are we ready
to return to the White Crest?”
</p>

<p>And those who had witnessed the incident of
Eleanor’s experience with the strange Cuban man
instantly followed Mrs. Courtney’s lead.
</p>

<p>The next day proved to be one of almost unbearable
tropical heat. The tourists found it necessary
to drive to the race-course in rickety old
carriages, because Jack had forgotten to engage
automobiles for his party and other American
sportsmen had anticipated the demand and had
commandeered every form of auto to be found.
</p>

<p>Mid merry jests and amused calls to each other,
the girls managed to finally dispose themselves in
the worn-cushioned, shaky seats of the century
old victorias, and at last Jack decided they were
ready to start.
</p>

<p>As these vehicles carry but few passengers at a
time, it was necessary for so large a party to have
four carriages, one after the other, as in a parade.
The dark drivers grinned and displayed glistening
white teeth at the wind-fall which would come
their way that day, in driving these New Yorkers
to the races.
</p>

<p>The Dalken party was rattled along under
long avenues of bamboo trees; past crowds of
native holiday makers dressed in all their gala
finery, who waved and shouted joyously at every
passing vehicle; through banana plantations
where the road led over slight knolls, or down
through woods to ford a stream where the wheels
of the laden carriages threatened to sink to the
hubs in sand; then up again and over a dusty road
where the heavy hoofs of the lazy horses caused
choking clouds of dust to settle upon the passengers
crowded so uncomfortably in the small
equipages.
</p>

<p>Finally the leading carriage in which sat Jack
and Polly, with Mrs. Courtney as chaperone,
reached a fenced in area where a number of uniformed
guards tried to keep peepers from securing
their view of the races for nothing. The
darky driver knew exactly where to halt, and then
he held out his hand for his fee.
</p>

<p>“You wait here where we can find you after
the races,” said Jack, without a move to take any
money from his pocket.
</p>

<p>“Ah, no! You get drive here, me get money
for it,” retorted the driver.
</p>

<p>“But I hired you for the entire afternoon!
You have only fulfilled part of the contract.
When you deliver us at the wharf I pay in full,”
explained Jack.
</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Dalken had been having the
same experience, but he paid the fee without stopping
to consider the reason for the untimely demand.
Finally, Jack’s driver capitulated and resigned
himself to the inevitable, and his three
passengers hurriedly joined the rest of their party.
</p>

<p>Jack came up just as Mr. Dalken counted out
the last bill.
</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Dalky! Don’t tell me you
paid him!” called Jack, impatiently.
</p>

<p>“The fellow was ready to call one of those
ridiculous policemen over and arrest me,” explained
Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“He’d have done nothing of the sort! Now
you will have to walk back or crowd in with us.
That rascal will hang about here until after the
races end, then pick up the highest bidder for his
rickety old chaise back to the city. If he had
been made to wait for his fee he would have been
too glad to take you back as agreed upon.”
</p>

<p>“Never mind, Dalky, you shall sit upon my
knee!” laughed Eleanor, teasingly.
</p>

<p>“You may regret this kindly offer, Nolla, when
the long dusty trip begins,” retorted Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>But further argument on the situation was interrupted
by a vendor of cocoanut juice. Closely
following this peddler came a bookmaker who
had been forbidden an entrance to the course.
He was sent the way of the vendor of drinks;
and then came a gayly garbed black who invited
the party to win great stakes at a new game—but
it was merely a decoy of the three-card monte
gamble.
</p>

<p>Accompanied on both sides by barkers for refreshments,
by touts, and by every sort of vendor
of anything salable, the Dalken party finally
found it possible to reach the entrance gate. Soon
after passing through here, the troublesome peddlers
were left behind, but a new form of buzzard
came to annoy. These were the professional
bookmakers and licensed gamblers who hoped to
turn a dishonest dollar their way.
</p>

<p>In threading a trail to the Grand Stand, Jack
led his party past family groups that sat under
the trees and picnicked gayly until the gong should
call all to the roped-off line that marked the
course. The Grand Stand, painted white and
decked in many-hued flags of friendly nations, was
reached after many side-steppings and turns.
Here the girls found army officers, professional
men from Havana, and a tableau of fashionably
dressed women with fans and parasols galore.
</p>

<p>As the horses were paraded past the Grand
Stand, and their gayly decked black jockeys acknowledged
the waving hands and applause of the
ladies to their favorites in the race, Polly turned
to Eleanor and said: “Dear me, I wish I could
bet!”
</p>

<p>“You can,” returned Eleanor. “Let’s call Jack
and tell him.”
</p>

<p>Jack heard and grinned. “Which is your favorite,
Poll?”
</p>

<p>“See this one on the programme—his name is
Will o’ the Wisp. Such a pretty name!”
</p>

<p>“Hoh, but he is absolutely no good!” declared
Jack. “He’s only entered because they need filling
the list on that race. No one will bet on him.
The odds are ridiculous.”
</p>

<p>“I don’t care what they say, I’m going to bet
five dollars on him,” asserted Polly.
</p>

<p>“But, dear girl, have you seen the scrawny
beast! Look out there and see him shambling
along after all the others,” argued Jack.
</p>

<p>Polly looked. Yes, she admitted that he was
a sorry-looking steed for a race, but still she insisted
upon her choice. A man was found who
laughed scornfully as he took her bet—Polly
would lose her five without a doubt. But she
shook her head and said knowingly:
</p>

<p>“No, you will be the one to lose thirty-five dollars,
I’m sure!” With a sympathetic laugh the
man went his way.
</p>

<p>Eleanor’s wager was almost as bad, because
she chose her favorite on account of appearances.
The horse was beautiful, to be sure, but he had
no record and consequently no bidding in his
favor.
</p>

<p>False starts were repeatedly made, and the impatient
jockeys had to come back and begin again.
Finally the judge really dropped the flag and they
were off!
</p>

<p>Then were heard excited calls, shrill cries from
anxious watchers, and, as the horses circled the
course, the tense urgings of men who had staked
all on a favorite, became more thrilling until the
home lap came in view. Then Jack’s party were
treated to a real Havana picture of a race.
</p>

<p>The jockeys in purple and gold, green and red,
pink and violet, and other combinations of colors,
sat humped over their mounts and urged them to
the utmost. Every jockey, as he neared the
Grand Stand, shouted excitedly and switched his
horse into greater effort. But all eyes seemed
glued to a miracle!
</p>

<p>Will o’ the Wisp, pitied and ridiculed at the
start of the races, carrying a faded-looking jockey
who clung with his knees to the sides of his horse
but used no whip, had crept up to his leaders before
half the course had been covered. Gradually
but surely he went on creeping up until he
came beside the last horse in the string. But he
did not stop there. He crept on until he had
passed that horse and then left him at the very
tail of the line. One by one he came nose to nose
with and then passed all contestants in the race
until he reached the leader of them all. Just as
easily as he had crept up and passed the others,
so he came on and passed the leader, and finally
let himself out on the home run.
</p>

<p>The mobs were breathless. Not a hurrah or
cry of encouragement sounded while Will O’ the
Wisp nosed ahead of the favorite in the lead, but
when he loped out ahead of them all and stretched
his neck to widen the distance between the favorite
and himself, the excited crowds gave vent to
one long shrill yell of delight! That was a race
worth seeing, no matter how many dollars were
lost on the books!
</p>

<p>Polly seemed to be one of a very few who had
wagered anything on Will o’ the Wisp, but her
friends declared she must understand horseflesh
better than they to have so quickly picked the
winner.
</p>

<p>The bookmaker who had felt sorry for the misguided
girl, now came over to pay his loss, but
he wore a far different expression than one he
had expected to wear. Polly accepted her winnings
with a serious manner, but once the bookmaker
was out of hearing, she said, “I really cannot
keep this money because I think it is wrong
to gamble on horses that way, so I will donate it
to the Havana Hospital when we get back to
town.”
</p>

<p>As Jack had feared, when they came out of the
Grand Stand and emerged from the race-course,
the jehu whom Mr. Dalken had paid off had
found an alluring fare to take home, and the three
who had come out in that vehicle found it necessary
to accept the hospitality of their friends and
crowded into the already crowded surreys. However
it made the ride to the yacht all the merrier,
and once the pier was reached the drivers found
it feasible to collect heavy toll for extra passengers
they had had to carry.
</p>

<p>The tax was paid, but Jack said angrily: “I
never did see such grafters as they have in Havana.
One can’t lift an eye-lash without being
made to pay for it!”
</p>

<p>That evening the Captain continued his course
along the coast of Cuba. The wonderful air,
laden with sweet perfumes of the tropical plants
that caused the indented coastline to look like a
fringed garment upon the smooth silvery waters,
made the tourists feel languid and only too willing
to loll upon deck and watch the swiftly passing
panorama of the island.
</p>

<p>The Captain planned to pass between Cuba and
Hayti, to reach the harbor at Kingston, Jamaica,
the next stopping place for the travelers. But
the younger members in the party clamored for a
sight of Port au Prince and its motley citizens.
</p>

<p>“You’ll find that Island anything but a desirable
place to visit,” objected Mr. Fabian, when
he heard the plans.
</p>

<p>“So Tom Latimer said, but we want to see the
worshippers of the sacred serpents,” said Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“You won’t see anything of the sort,” remonstrated
Mr. Dalken. “They keep all such performances
secret from civilized people. About
the only thing you will find, however, is a city rich
in vice and unhealthy with filth. You’ll see blacks
and half-breeds mince along the streets dressed in
the very latest Parisian fashions, with the manners
of western outlaws, and the morals of a dive
dweller.”
</p>

<p>“In other words, my girls, a place we cannot
allow you to visit,” was Mrs. Courtney’s conclusive
remark. So that settled all hope of visiting
Hayti.
</p>

<p>Long before the yacht reached Hayti, however,
the younger members of the party were anxious to
reach Kingston, where Jack described such alluring
attractions. Little coaxing was necessary to
persuade Mr. Dalken to anchor at Kingston for
a few days in order to give the tourists ample time
to visit all the places worth seeing.
</p>

<p>Then, at last, the White Crest passed within
a stone’s throw of Port-au-Prince, and leaving the
Island of Hayti behind, made a straight course
for Jamaica.
</p>

<p>Skirting along the low-lying, palm-treed shores
of this beautiful isle, the watching group on the
yacht found it rather warm pastime on deck with
the tropical sun burning blisters on the hand-rails
of the boat, and reflecting in all its power the
burning rays as they struck the smooth, mirror-like
sea.
</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning of any kind, a darkness
fell and the sun disappeared. Down came
the rain in a regular deluge that sent everyone
pell mell into the saloon for shelter. The waterfall
continued for about ten minutes, then abated
and suddenly, once more, the sun shone forth as
hot as ever.
</p>

<p>Exercise was intolerable in this climate, and the
guests on board the White Crest found the only
agreeable pastime to be a comfortable chair on
deck where one could watch the flying fish, the
pretty little nautilus gliding past, and the dolphin
play and jump in the transparent depths of the
sea. At times a hungry shark would follow the
boat, looking for the garbage thrown out by the
cook.
</p>

<p>That night there was the last of the full moon,
but what a different moon from that as seen in
New York! A few hours after sighting the lighthouse
on Morant Point, the watchers saw the first
peaks of the Blue Mountains. The yacht sped
past sugar plantations, low-roofed, silvery-white
houses, glistening roads—glistening in the
moonbeams—and wonderful groves of cocoanut or
banana palms whose tall fronds waved a welcome
to the girls.
</p>

<p>Passing along six miles of the coral ridge one
does not realize how near is Kingston, hidden by
the strip of reef, until, quite suddenly, you discover
the town. It is entirely hemmed in by its
mountains, and on only one side approached by
the beautiful lagoon through the waters of which
the White Crest now danced to reach the mystical-looking
place situated about six miles away, at
the end of the harbor.
</p>

<p>That night the yacht made fast to a wooden
quay where black-faced, white-teethed men
awaited the coming of the rich quarry. Not often
did they have such a fine craft come to Kingston,
and each and every son of the soil planned how
to fleece the members of the party. But all were
doomed to disappointment for that night, as the
time being almost midnight, Mr. Dalken said no
one would go ashore, until the morning.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII—LOST IN KINGSTON</h1>

<p>Directly after breakfast the next morning,
Mr. Dalken and his guests, having first agreed to
meet on the yacht that evening at seven for dinner,
made ready to start on a tour of inspection.
</p>

<p>The girls in light summer dresses, had donned
their wide-brimmed hats, and taken sun-shades for
protection from the sun; and the men had dressed
in white flannels and Panama hats, in order to
keep as cool as possible.
</p>

<p>“One last word,” advised Mr. Dalken, as Jack
stood ready to lead his party to the wharf.
“Don’t let those rascally hackmen get your
money. Better walk about, while the air is cool
and fresh. Later we shall have to remain on the
verandah of the Spring Hotel to sip lemonade
and fan ourselves.”
</p>

<p>The friends laughed gayly and started off.
The younger contingent of the touring party went
first, the elders following in a leisurely manner
while conversing with their host. Jack and Ray
led the way across the dock to the entrance which,
to their chagrin, was blocked completely by the
hacks which they had been so recently warned
against.
</p>

<p>Jack looked in every direction for an opening.
There were none. “Well, girls, it’s a case of taking
the bull by the horns. I’ll grab one of these
old nags by the head and lead him out; then you
can follow through the gap and land on the other
side of this mob which is after our money—that’s
what it is!”
</p>

<p>No sooner said than done; hence Ray, not caring
to be considered a laggard in such a good
work, followed suit and caught hold of the head
of a horse next the one taken by Jack. But the
men who owned these animals felt that they had
a right in the matter. At the very moment that
Jack caught hold of the bit of the horse, the black
driver lashed the flank of his beast unmercifully,
causing the horse to start and tear across the open
square in front of the quay. Naturally this unexpected
move dragged Jack from his feet, and in
constant danger of being trampled or kicked, he
found it unwise to let go his hold.
</p>

<p>The girls stood and screamed, but Ray let go
his hold on the other horse and dashed madly
after his friend. He thought the horse was running
away, with Jack hanging to his head. By
the time Polly collected her wits enough to act,
Jack was out of sight around the corner, and Ray
was sprinting after the equipage which had been
lost in a cloud of yellow dust.
</p>

<p>“Here! Jump in and let’s go after them!”
ordered Eleanor, as she spied a hack with a good
looking horse in its shafts.
</p>

<p>Polly sprang in and Eleanor followed, but before
Ruth or Nancy could get in, the driver
slammed the door and off he went, in a whirl of
dust. Ruth and Nancy stood dumb and watched
them go.
</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Dalken and his friends came
up. He looked around in surprise. “Why!
Where is Jack and the others?”
</p>

<p>“Oh, Dalky!” cried Ruth, “Jack’s been run
away with and the two girls have been kidnapped!”
</p>

<p>“Impossible! In broad daylight?” exclaimed
many voices.
</p>

<p>Nancy tried to explain all that had happened
in so short a time, then Mr. Dalken laughed.
“Exactly what I advised you against. If we had
landed last night every one would have been
whipped into a separate vehicle and carried off to
a different hotel. These drivers are paid to drag
visitors to the various houses willy-nilly, and once
the tourists arrive, they are so frightened at their
experience, they usually remain where they have
been left. But where did the man take Polly and
Eleanor?”
</p>

<p>While he spoke, such a clamor and wrangling
of drivers at the elbows of each one in the group,
drove Mr. Dalken distracted. Finally he turned
and held up a hand for silence. Little cared these
black men for New York authority or prestige.
They all wanted a fare, and that was all.
</p>

<p>“There’s but one thing to do—each one of us
get in a separate hack and tell the man to drive
you to the Spring Hotel. When you arrive there
tell him to wait for me—that I carry the purse.
That will cool their blood and have them ready
for me when I arrive.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian laughed, but it was the only solution
to rid themselves of being pulled to tatters by
the myriad of besieging men. Quickly then
Mr. and Mrs. Fabian got in one cab, Mr. and
Mrs. Ashby in another, Nancy and Ruth with Mr.
Dalken got in a third, and all started off.
</p>

<p>As far as weather went, the day was beautiful
and calm. But the old rackety hacks went seesawing
over the yellow road whence one could see
the blue edge of the sea far out beyond the coral
reefs. White bits of sail on distant little vessels
made bright spots on the blue glassy horizon.
Finally, after a drive of not more than ten blocks,
but a trip which the wily drivers had stretched out
into twenty blocks by going round about the town,
the first load of shaken-up passengers reached the
hotel verandah. The driver brought his horse to
a sudden stop with a wild hurrah and a flourish
of the limp whip. Then he sprang to the ground
and demanded his money.
</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait for the last man to arrive.
He has the money,” explained Mr. Fabian, as
instructed.
</p>

<p>Such a volley of expletives then poured from
the man’s mouth that Mrs. Fabian covered her
ears and ran for the hotel porch. But a diversion
occurred in having the second hack arrive and
crash into the first one. The Ashbys stepped out
with shaking nerves and white faces.
</p>

<p>“Oh, such a drive!” gasped Mrs. Ashby, but
the driver interrupted her by demanding his
money.
</p>

<p>He received the same reply as that given to the
first driver. The second man could curse even
more fluently than the one who had sent Mrs.
Fabian scurrying away. But Mr. Ashby quietly
took one step forward and caught the whip from
the darky’s hand. Instantly he cowered and
bobbed as if in apology.
</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Dalken’s equipage, with Ruth
and Nancy in mortal dread of being killed before
the man would stop his horse.
</p>

<p>“Where is Jack and the other girls?” asked
Mr. Dalken, looking around in wonderment. He
had fully expected to find them all there.
</p>

<p>Before any one could reply, the wrangling over
the fares began again. Each driver claimed four
times the usual fee, but Mr. Dalken understood
them, and when at last he had settled for the regular
price of a dollar a trip, they smiled politely
and drove away.
</p>

<p>“You see, in these isles, one must never pay the
price demanded. The native holds the highest
regard and esteem for those who know the ropes
and stick to one price—generally it is four to five
times less than that asked. Remember this when
you go shopping, ladies,” said Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“But what will you do about Polly and Nolla—and
the two lost boys?” asked Ruth, anxiously.
</p>

<p>“We will go over on the verandah and order
long cool drinks of orangeade and wait for them.
They will come, all right, when the driver hears
that they wish to stop at this hotel,” said Mr.
Dalken.
</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a little worried?” asked Mrs.
Courtney.
</p>

<p>“No, not in Kingston. It would have been different
in Havana or Hayti. Here, every one is as
honest as the drinks—and they are temperance
and pure. No synthetic orangeade for your
money.” The laughing tone and reassuring manner
of their host made his friends feel confident
that soon the lost members of their party would
arrive with varied tales of adventures.
</p>

<p>Meanwhile young Baxter had managed to cause
such a drag on the horse, to which he clung like
grim death, that the animal stopped on a side
lane where the blinding dust measured at least ten
inches in depth. Natty Jack, in his once immaculate
white flannels and silk shirt, looked for all
the world as if he had been purposely caked with
Jamaica dust an inch thick. Even his hair and
eyebrows stuck out in yellow thickness. As the
horse stopped Jack let go and sat down upon the
ground with a heavy sigh.
</p>

<p>“Aigh, you-all pays me free dollahs!” demanded
the driver.
</p>

<p>The owner of the animal now stood over Jack
and scowled fiercely. “Mebbe dat hoss goin’ to
git heaves f’on all dis hawd wu’k. Mebbe you’se
got’ta pay foh my hoss, too!”
</p>

<p>This was too much for poor Jack! He sprang
up and there, in the isolation of that Jamaica lane
shadowed by over-hanging palms, he started a
regular fight with the driver. The astonished
man, never thinking of striking back, went flat
upon his back in the same dust where his victim
had been seated a moment before.
</p>

<p>Jack jumped into the front seat of the hack,
whipped up the nag with the same whip the driver
had brandished over him just a minute previously,
and before the amazed fellow could think, his
vehicle had passed out of sight around a corner
of the lane.
</p>

<p>While this went on, Ray sprinted as swiftly as
if he was running a Marathon, but he was no
match for the whipped horse which carried his
friend to only goodness knows where. But Ray
could not keep up the pace overlong, so he quietly
subsided in front of a fruit stall and paid for a
reviving drink of green cocoanut milk, thereby
earning himself a stool upon which to sit and rest
from the frightful strain in a tropical temperature.
</p>

<p>While he sat there slowly sipping the cooling
beverage, the carriage with Polly and Eleanor
seated within drove past the fruit vendor’s booth.
Ray was too exhausted to jump up and follow,
but he decided that the girls were on their way
to the Spring Hotel. Hence he turned his attention
again to the drink.
</p>

<p>The driver of the surrey in which the two girls
had climbed, had no intention of taking his fares
to the well-known Spring Hotel, because he was
paid extra for every guest he could deposit at a
small and practically new boarding house of third-rate
class. Naturally this landlady found great
difficulty in securing guests, and she found it necessary
to pay the hack drivers a commission for
their collaboration.
</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor saw themselves whisked
along mean streets lined on both sides with a
bungalow type of houses; these dwellings
apparently were filled to overflowing with people of
varied shades of black and brown, down to a pale
yellow. Every now and then the driver of the
vehicle had to swerve out of the way for a tramcar
track at street crossings. At such crossings
the girls saw the business street, down which the
cars had their tracks, busy with tourists and shop
keepers who called from their emporiums to attract
attention to their wares on sale.
</p>

<p>“For all the world like the East Side in New
York, isn’t it?” asked Eleanor, as both girls gazed
with interest at all they saw.
</p>

<p>After driving his “fares” in and out of many
byways, the hack man brought his horse up before
a shabby house of somewhat larger dimensions
than any bungalow the girls had yet seen.
Here he opened the broken-hinged door of his
surrey and bowed to let them know they were to
step out and pay their bill.
</p>

<p>Several indolent guests, who plainly showed
their plane of life, sat upon the rickety chairs on
the narrow verandah which <span class='it'>hung</span> desperately to
the front of the “Hotel.” The landlady, a great
bulk of light yellow tint, came out to greet her
new guests.
</p>

<p>Polly glanced over the place in amazement, and
Eleanor felt inclined to double up in laughter.
She had to cover her mouth with her hand in order
to choke back the wild shout of amusement
that <span class='it'>would</span> demand a vent.
</p>

<p>“Why, what do you call this place?” demanded
Polly of the driver, frowning upon him in stern
anger.
</p>

<p>“Dis am de ho-tel you wants to come to,” replied
he.
</p>

<p>“I told you to drive us to the Spring Hotel, and
this never is <span class='it'>it</span>!”
</p>

<p>“No’m, you’se says foh me to drive you-all
affer dat man what cotched hoi’ of dat hoss’s
head. Well, dat hoss and man done runned away
somewhere, so I jus’ brings you to the fust-class
place I knows of,” explained the driver.
</p>

<p>Eleanor now screamed with laughter at the
funny experience, and was unable to help Polly in
her cross-examination of the man.
</p>

<p>“You get back in that seat and take us to
the Spring Hotel, or I will hand you over
to the police!” threatened Polly, but she could
not help wondering if Kingston ever had a police
force!
</p>

<p>“Ef I has to take you-all another trip, it’s goin’
to cost more money,” bargained the fellow, not
knowing the nature of the girl he thought he had
at a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>Polly leaned out from the door of the hack.
“You get in that seat in double-quick time or
you’ll find out where I came from! Did you ever
hear of Colorado people who know how to shoot
a fly from a swinging street lamp forty feet away?
Well, that’s me!” Polly’s tone was that of a
hangman’s, her expression similar to that of an
Empress who is judging a criminal, her sudden
wave of the hand that of a western hold-up man.
The driver, never having had such a “fare” with
which to deal, obeyed like a whipped puppy. He
climbed back into his seat and drove away midst
the jeers and hoots of the loafers on the hang-too
verandah. Even the landlady of the house jeered
at him.
</p>

<p>By this time Eleanor found herself able to gasp
forth a cheer for Polly. But Polly turned blazing
eyes upon her friend and said: “A fine assistant
you will make in time of need!”
</p>

<p>“Oh, Polly, what could you expect of me in
such a ridiculous predicament? You looked too
surprised and shocked for anything!”
</p>

<p>But Polly was really offended this time, and
she would not reply to Eleanor’s attempts at
making up. Not until the meek driver turned into
the beautiful avenue that brought them up in
front of the Spring Hotel, where all but Jack
and Ray lounged in great comfortable wicker
chairs and sipped orangeade, did she forgive
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>Polly gave one glance at her friends and stiffened
up. “Well! Is that the way you-all trouble
over the safety of Nolla and me? We might
have been offered up on the altar of the voodoo
worshippers for all you cared!”
</p>

<p>“We knew you would be perfectly safe in this
town—no such menace as voodooism here,”
laughed Mr. Dalken, coming down the three steps
to welcome his charges.
</p>

<p>“Two sov’ren’s, please,” now demanded the
driver.
</p>

<p>“Two what?” shouted Mr. Ashby, who had
joined his friend.
</p>

<p>With not so much bravado the hackman said:
“I druv dese ladies all over Kingston tryin’ to
keep up wid dere young man. Now I got’ta be
paid foh all dat trouble.”
</p>

<p>“Dalky, he never did! He took us way off
to a dump of a house where he tried to make us
believe you would come to board. I actually had
to threaten to shoot him, as we do out west, before
he would condescend to bring us here,” explained
Polly, her color rising ominously as she
glared at the man.
</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you exactly what all fares are from
the wharf to this hotel—here’s a dollar a fare,
and that makes two dollars. Now begone before
this young sixshooter gets out a gun and
wings your ear!” Mr. Dalken tossed the man
two dollars and waved him away.
</p>

<p>The driver caught the money with one hand,
caught hold of the iron rail of the front seat with
his other hand and swung himself up. In another
moment he was whipping his horse and whizzing
off out of range of that gun. He had never in his
life delivered a fare who had such spirit as that
western girl expressed, and he began to ponder
whether the life of a hackman was the most delightful
one now that women in the States had
suffrage and could carry guns!
</p>

<p>A coal-black waiter brought more cooling
drinks to the parched guests, and when Polly had
emptied a long thin glass filled with iced orangeade,
she felt better. Then she explained.
</p>

<p>The interested audience laughed, but when she
demanded: “What did you do with Jack and
Ray?” no one could reply.
</p>

<p>“I’m here to answer for myself,” came a weak,
quavering voice from the road. Every one
jumped up and ran to the steps, and there stood
poor Jack, still coated with heavy dust and
painfully clambering out of the one-sided carriage.
</p>

<p>Such a ludicrous picture did dandy Jack present
to his friends that they could not restrain a shout
of laughter. He looked hurt but shook his head
hopelessly. “I knew what sort of friends I had!”
he muttered as he limped up the steps and
dropped into a chair. As he fell into its cushioned
depths a choking cloud of dust rose from his
form and floated over the group that now surrounded
him.
</p>

<p>Before Jack had concluded his narrative Ray
came up to the steps of the hotel and joined his
friends. With his appearance the others called
for an explanation of his clean-looking summer
garb, his cool-looking face, and the smile that
told he had not had such disturbing experiences as
the other three wanderers in an unknown town.
</p>

<p>“I saw a driver whisking Polly and Eleanor
past my resting place, but they went too fast for
my speed.” Ray laughed as he remembered again
the perplexed girls in that hack.
</p>

<p>“Well, now that we are reunited, children, let
us celebrate with another flagon of orangeade,”
laughed Mr. Fabian, calling the waiter to take
the order.
</p>

<p>As they all sipped another gallon of cooling
drink, they planned what to see after they had
recovered from the strenuous trip from the quay
to the Hotel.
</p>

<p>“You know, we won’t be able to visit every
point of interest in Jamaica, but at least we shall
see those which are most worth while,” explained
Mr. Dalken. Then turning to Jack, he said,
“You’ve been here before, Jack—where do you
advise us to take the party?”
</p>

<p>“Well, every one ought to see the natives dive
for coins—that’s one of the amusements offered
here; but that can be done as we come from the
yacht to-morrow morning,” said Jack. At this
suggestion, Polly interpolated:
</p>

<p>“I hope to goodness you don’t expect us to run
the gauntlet of those buggy drivers again, do
you?”
</p>

<p>And Eleanor said: “Why not camp out at this
hotel as long as we are here. I find it delightfully
cool and restful here.”
</p>

<p>“At least we might stay here to-night, Dalky,”
added Ray.
</p>

<p>“I’m willing. The Captain will understand if
we do not return by ten o’clock to-night.”
</p>

<p>It was therefore decided that the entire party
would remain at the Spring Hotel that night and,
should they find the evening entertainment alluring
enough, they might remain another night.
</p>

<p>“That means we ladies must get out and shop
for requisites we will need overnight,” ventured
Mrs. Fabian.
</p>

<p>“I was wondering if it would not be wise to do
some shopping this afternoon,” added Mrs.
Ashby.
</p>

<p>“We may as well do all the shopping we plan
to do, as long as we are at it,” suggested Mrs.
Courtney.
</p>

<p>“Well, if you ladies are going to shop, what do
you expect the male members of the party to do
to kill time?” asked Ray.
</p>

<p>“Why, go along and pay the bills, to be sure!”
laughed Mr. Ashby.
</p>

<p>“What else do you think a married man can
do?” added Mr. Fabian.
</p>

<p>About this time the gong boy came out on the
verandah and made such a deafening din with the
hammer and copper drum he carried that John
Baxter beckoned him over.
</p>

<p>“What’s the game now, Bo?” asked Jack.
</p>

<p>“Lunsh’on, sah!” answered the young boy,
pounding with might and main that all should
hear the call to midday luncheon. But he looked
at the dusty young man who questioned him, then
showed his mighty disdain at the awful clothes
covered with Jamaica real estate, by curling his
nostrils and walking away from Jack.
</p>

<p>Midst a merry peal of laughter at his expense,
Jack got up and limped into the hotel in order to
secure a room with bath where he might relieve
his person of the undesirable weight of earth.
</p>

<p>He had not been gone a minute ere a dusty,
angry driver stumbled up the steps and gazed
wildly at the group where his “fare” had been
seated. Not seeing a man answering to the description,
the man sought everywhere—inside and
outside, for the man who had taken the license
of using his horse and hack without permission,
and left <span class='it'>him</span>, the owner, to walk all the way to the
Spring Hotel to recover his business assets.
</p>

<p>During the time the furious driver sought him,
Jack reclined in a luxurious bath and managed to
relieve himself and his hair of all the clinging
dust he had accumulated in that mad race through
knee-deep dust on the side-streets of Jamaica.
</p>

<p>Mourning the loss of collecting the damages
he had expected to claim from the New Yorker,
the hack driver had to leave in his recovered surrey.
But he made up his weak mind to find that
young man when he should reappear on the quay
some day to leave the town.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX—THE SIGHTS OF JAMAICA</h1>

<p>The climate of this the largest of the islands
of the West Indies, was as perfect as climate can
be. The heat was, of course, tropical; but that
was tempered by sea-breezes forever blowing
from one direction or another, and as the island
is not too mountainous to obstruct these breezes,
one can always find relief from the warmth of the
sunshine.
</p>

<p>The streets, where the best shops are located,
are a busy sight, indeed, especially during tourists’
season, when crowds of visitors are eagerly
selecting souvenirs for home-friends. These
tradesmen consider a buyer, who does not bargain
for his purchase, a brainless creature to be
despised. In fact, one must offer the merchant
just about one quarter of the price asked first if
he wishes to win esteem and admiration from the
native. Many times a buyer secures reverence if
he turns and pretends to walk out of the booth,
and then pauses to listen to the beseeching salesman
to turn and take the desirable article at his
own figure!
</p>

<p>As the ladies in Mr. Dalken’s party sauntered
from one shop to another, enjoying the unusual
fun of driving hard bargains (as the proprietor
of the hotel had warned them to do) the men attended
stalls where they purchased native hats,
curios, and walking sticks or umbrellas with odd
handles and of splendid workmanship.
</p>

<p>They finally wound up in the market place, but
it was too late in the day to witness the thrill and
thrall of marketing as is seen in the early mornings.
Mr. Dalken learned that on Saturdays the
country people foregathered in the great market
to sell their produce and invest the returns in
their own needs. The man added with a smile at
the ladies:
</p>

<p>“If you visit here on Sata’day, better wear a
big bunch of strong scented flowers directly under
your nose. The smells of the crowded stalls
and the decaying fruit or vegetables, to say nothing
of fowl and fish spread out on boards in the
heat to attract the buyers but the flies as well, will
not be the pleasantest scent to get.”
</p>

<p>“I should say it will be as well to keep away
from such a powerful combined odor, eh?” was
Mr. Dalken’s smiling answer.
</p>

<p>“But the sight is well worth the insult to the
other sense,” retorted the man who had a sense
of humor as well as wit.
</p>

<p>“Thank you for the suggestions. If we are
still in the town we will call again,” returned Mr.
Dalken, lifting his hat and turning to leave the
market place.
</p>

<p>That afternoon the tourists returned to the hotel
laden with purchases. Not only were the
ladies almost bankrupt from spending money on
hand-embroidered undergarments and basketwork
ornaments, but they also had been lured into buying
savage designs of jewelry and art objects.
The men bought ebony paper cutters, desk outfits,
wonderful whips made from lace-bark, and
even fishing-rods made of bamboo, with marvelous
handles mounted on a shark’s backbone.
Some of the rods had handles of sandalwood, and
were genuine curios in carvings.
</p>

<p>At dinner that evening the hotel manager came
over to Mr. Dalken’s table and introduced himself.
</p>

<p>“I wish to invite you to a reception given this
evening at Government House. My guests are always
welcome at these entertainments; there you
will meet our Jamaican society.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken thanked the host and said: “I am
sure we appreciate your hospitable invitation. If
the ladies wish to go we shall enjoy the reception.”
</p>

<p>Naturally the ladies voted to go, and this
necessitated a return trip to the yacht in order to
dress for the evening. They had heard how particular
were the aspirants to social favor, as regards
the demands of proper dress at all functions.
Therefore Mr. Dalken chartered a car
and soon had his guests back at the quay and on
board his yacht where they hurriedly arrayed
themselves in evening clothes.
</p>

<p>At the reception that evening the Americans
found a mixed society. Military, civic officialdom,
and those who could be classed with the
Dalken group. Dress was a very important item
in this gathering, and every lady present, be she
pure white, milk-white (which really showed she
was an octoroon) or yellow, flaunted the most
gorgeous gowns. Many dresses could claim
Parisian birth, and others came from the best
Fifth Avenue shops in New York City. The
females in the yacht party now saw the very latest
ideas in style, and they were honestly amazed at
such a revelation. Later they heard that style
and display of their clothes constituted the main
interest in life for the Kingston society ladies.
</p>

<p>Dancing is the favorite amusement of the
Jamaicans, and they take advantage of every opportunity
to dance, morning, noon, or night.
Hence a reception of such importance as one at
Government House provides a great opportunity
for dancing. The younger members in Mr. Dalken’s
party found all the dancing they could stand
at that time. Even the elder members were lured
into dancing several seductive waltzes that evening,
and Polly saw for the first time what a
graceful and admirable pair Mrs. Courtney and
Mr. Dalken made as dancing partners.
</p>

<p>While they waited for the automobile which
had been engaged for the evening, Polly whispered
to Eleanor: “Haven’t you noticed how
Dalky has bloomed since that blight of Elizabeth
has been removed?”
</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! And I’m glad of it. Her reckless
running away with those horrid persons that
night really turned out to be the very best thing
for our Dalky in the end. Now he can enjoy
himself to his heart’s content without being spied
upon,” said Eleanor.
</p>

<p>The ladies were now crowded into the automobile,
while the men went to the tram to ride as
far as it carried them in the direction of the
Spring Hotel. The air was cool and refreshing
during the night, and the dancing had not caused
any one to feel too tired or languid, as might
have been expected in such a climate.
</p>

<p>A good sleep at night and a refreshing bath
with a fine breakfast in the morning, brought
forth eager and energetic tourists in Mr. Dalken’s
party that next morning.
</p>

<p>“Well, what is on the bill for to-day?” demanded
Jack, eagerly.
</p>

<p>“You sound as if you knew of something,”
countered Polly.
</p>

<p>“I do. I heard of it last night from one of the
officers in the Army. Do you want to hear it?”
</p>

<p>Of course they wanted to hear it. But it was
far different than anything they expected to hear.
</p>

<p>“There is a trial in the Court House this morning
at ten, of a young man who helped himself to
a stick of sweets on sale by a street peddler, of
which class Kingston is full and overflowing. The
lieutenant is called upon as a witness of the theft,
and the brown policeman who caught the fellow
red-handed, is going to make the most of his
claim to promotion on the force. I hear it will
be as good as any vaudeville show in the city,”
explained Jack.
</p>

<p>“It seems a pity to waste a fine morning in an
ill-smelling courtroom, when there are so many
other interesting things to do,” argued Mr. Fabian,
whose artistic instincts rebelled against a
court scene as an amusement.
</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d love to witness such a scene,” declared
Eleanor, glancing at her girl-friends to see what
they thought about it.
</p>

<p>“Supposing you folks—all who wish to—go
on a drive all about the country, while we youngsters
attend court,” ventured Ray.
</p>

<p>“If I thought we could trust the girls to you
two scapegraces in such a place as a Kingston
Court House, I’d accept the suggestion,” returned
Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“I’ll go with the girls to the court, and you all
can go for a sight-seeing trip,” offered Mrs.
Courtney.
</p>

<p>“Would you really care to sit out a court
trial?” asked Mrs. Fabian, sympathetically for
her friend.
</p>

<p>“I think I’d prefer to be amused this morning
instead of sight-seeing around the country,” answered
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>So it was hastily decided that the young people,
chaperoned by Mrs. Courtney, were to attend
court, while Mr. Dalken took his friends on a
tram ride out into the open country of Jamaica.
</p>

<p>Jack acted as official pilot of the contingent for
the court house; as they came near the entrance
door they found a crowd of all sorts of people
waiting to see justice administered.
</p>

<p>Inside, the good-looking young lieutenant was
introduced to Jack’s party, and then he found
seats in a desirable row where every incident could
be seen, yet they would not be elbowed by the
motley gathering.
</p>

<p>The court room was nothing more than a large
room with a raised platform at one end. Rude
wooden benches were placed in rows for the accommodation
of the audience and those who
would have to report when their names were
called from the roll in the clerk’s hands.
</p>

<p>Upon the platform was the judge. He sat in
an old swivel chair behind a table, and every now
or then he leaned back in weary listlessness, but
just as surely as he tilted back a bit too far, the
treacherous pivot would squeak and the chair
went back, being kept from over-turning by the
clutch in the swivel. At these tilts the judge
would throw out both arms and yank his body
upright in order to regain his equilibrium. A
deep-seated grunt announced the success of his attempts
at balancing, and the trial would proceed
as before the interruption. The spectators in the
room dared not smile, nor even seem to be interested
in the result of the tip of the magistrate’s
chair, but each one maintained a serious expression
as if life and limb depended upon their dignified
attention to the witness on the stand. With
the advent of Eleanor to the court room all this
was to be reversed.
</p>

<p>Jack whispered to the girls: “Is this bench all
right for you to see the show?”
</p>

<p>Instantly the judge ceased playing with his
heavy-rimmed horn spectacles and sat upright.
He glared over at the newcomers, but finding
that they paid no attention to him he thumped the
top of the table with a mallet: “Order in the
Court!” shouted he.
</p>

<p>The girls were seated now, and Ruth looked up
with awe at the man who had just spoken.
Nancy glanced around the room and wrinkled her
dainty nose at the crowding of whites, yellows,
and blacks in one small area. Polly watched the
severe judge, but Eleanor was all eyes for the
witness on the platform. Jack and Ray stood
back of the bench upon which sat the girls, and
watched for the fun they had been promised.
</p>

<p>The ancient clerk, a picturesque form, now got
upon his feet and read from a legal paper the
name and crime of one Al Colman. Down in
front of the platform sat a black giant. Fittingly
his name was “Colman.” But he was not experienced
in court manners so he did not answer to
the call of his name.
</p>

<p>The judge toyed impatiently with the mallet of
authority, but he would not so far demean himself
as to bring the prisoner to understand his
lesson. Rather, he glared at the Clerk, who was
a yellow-white, and demanded of him:
</p>

<p>“Got the prisoner in the Court?” he could
plainly see the nervous Al just in front of his
table, but that was not justice as he weighed it
out to menials.
</p>

<p>The Clerk lowered the paper, stared over his
specs at Al, and called impatiently: “Why don’
you answer when I calls yoh name, Al?” The
Americans smiled at the first bit of play.
</p>

<p>“D’ye want me to?” demanded Al Colman,
wriggling uneasily. He was a ragged, ignorant
black, who looked too stupid to steal.
</p>

<p>“Shore! Got a lawyer t’ defen’ yuh?” demanded
the Clerk.
</p>

<p>“How come yuh ast me dat? Yuh knows I
ain’t got nuff money to git me a moufful to eat?”
retorted Al. Eleanor laughed and the judge
thumped the table furiously and bawled out:
</p>

<p>“Order in this Court!”
</p>

<p>“Step up to the chair, Al, and be examined,”
advised the Clerk.
</p>

<p>Poor Al, getting up from his bench as if it was
to be the last act on earth for him, crept up to the
platform and shook as he lifted imploring eyes to
the severe magistrate above him. This tickled
the egotism of the judge mightily and he frowned
down upon the trembling prisoner.
</p>

<p>“Step up and answer all questions truthfully!”
commanded he.
</p>

<p>Al obeyed and after he had taken the oath to
speak the “truf, the hull truf, an’ nuttin’ but de
truf,” the lawyer for the plaintiff began his story.
</p>

<p>“’N it please yuh honor, yistiddy whiles I was
lookin’ over important papers, I hears a hue an’
cry outside my office window, so I jumps up and
looks. Down th’ street went dis niggeh an’ a affer
him went a lady of color what sells sweets on the
street—she got a genuwine license from you, yuh
honor,” the man interrupted himself, suddenly remembering
how important such an item would be
in influencing justice.
</p>

<p>The magistrate bowed with dignity, and the
plaintiff continued: “Dis Al Colman held a stick
of sweets an’ was beatin’ it foh de open when I
steps out and interviews de hull thing. It is a
plain case of larceny, yuh honor, an’ my client
claims damages an’ costs. I have an important
witness to testify to de truf of dis situation, yuh
honor.”
</p>

<p>The judge glared at poor Al and the self-styled
lawyer beckoned to Lieutenant Bray to step up.
But Jack had already whispered to Bray to go
easy on the poor black man, and call on his friends
if he needed any help in dragging Al out of the
ditch.
</p>

<p>The lawyer next asked Al all sorts of questions,
in order to catch him lying or attempting to get
out of the claim of theft.
</p>

<p>“Whar yuh reside, Al?” demanded the lawyer.
</p>

<p>“Anywhar I finds a welcome,” murmured Al,
his eyes fixed upon the splendor of the officer’s
uniform as he came up to offer his testimony in
the case.
</p>

<p>“And what yuh works at, Al?” demanded the
questioner suavely, satisfied with the reply to his
first question.
</p>

<p>“Now yuh know I does any odd job I kin git,”
said Al.
</p>

<p>“How come yuh helped yuh-self to dem sweets,
Al?” was the next question.
</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice behind Polly interrupted the
proceedings: “I object to that question until you
have proved that the man took them!”
</p>

<p>Every head turned to the owner of the new
voice. The girls and Jack and Ray started in
surprise to find Mr. Dalken had entered unseen
and was watching this unusual trial.
</p>

<p>“Order in this Court!” thundered the judge.
Then to the sheriff, he said: “Eject that man who
interrupts the proceeding of the Law.”
</p>

<p>But Mr. Dalken now stepped down to the front
and said: “I am the legal representative for this
Al Colman. I object to the irregular questions
asked of my client.”
</p>

<p>Al Colman’s jaw dropped and his whole body
slumped in the rickety chair. The judge was so
startled that he brought the swivel chair to an
upright position with such suddenness that the
clutch broke and dropped out, but he never knew
it. He stared at the new lawyer and scowled his
unwelcome.
</p>

<p>“Who are you and why didn’t you step up
aforetime?”
</p>

<p>“I just managed to reach the Court, your
Honor, and now I offer my services to this undefended
man on trial for stealing sweets.” Mr.
Dalken’s manner was sugary and Jack hugged
himself. He anticipated great fun with the renowned
New York lawyer taking a part. Even
the lieutenant smiled with delight at the turn in
events. Only Al seemed overwhelmed and depressed
by the aspect his case was taking.
</p>

<p>The old woman who sold sweets on the street
lifted bleary eyes to her lawyer and grumbled:
“I’s is losin’ all de mawnin’ trade wid dis foolin’
bout dat stick of sugar cane! Lem’me go!”
</p>

<p>“Order in the Court!” thundered the judge,
banging the table. He <span class='it'>could</span> let out his spleen on
the table and it could not object.
</p>

<p>The case first advanced a step, then receded a
step, until Mr. Dalken brought his legal experience
to bear on his colleague’s legal understanding.
Thus matters drifted and were halted over
and over, when a suspicious sound from the magistrate
in the broken swivel chair announced that
he was snoring, while the two lawyers wrangled in
front of his platform. Al Colman sat in stupefied
wonderment at all he heard but he was not sure
whether they were going to send him to the chair,
or to jail for life. Every one in the room was
tittering at the discomfiture of the lawyer for the
old street peddler, when a new phase occurred.
</p>

<p>“Now, see heah, all yuh fo’kses! I done gone
lost a stick of sugar yistiddy, but I lose all my
pence o’ trade to-day cuz, of bein’ hauled in heah
agin my will. I ain’t got no cause nohow to git Al
Colman inter jail, an’ <span class='it'>I’se</span> discharge dis case!”
As she rendered judgment in a hoarse voice which
was familiar on the street as coming from a full-lung-powered
huckster, she turned to leave the
room.
</p>

<p>Whether the sound of a woman usurping his
rights of judgment, or whether the laughter of the
crowd in the court room aroused him, cannot be
determined, but the judge suddenly let go his balance
in the chair in order to get up and demand
order. The swivel instantly pivoted, and the
clutch being gone, back went the chair, tossing
His Honor upon his head behind the table.
</p>

<div class='wx400 imgcenter'>
<img class='wx400' src='images/illus-201.jpg'	alt='' />
<p class='caption wx400'>BACK WENT THE CHAIR, TOSSING THE JUDGE UPON HIS HEAD.</p>
</div>

<p>Then followed such an uproar that Al made a
quick escape without being seen. Out of the side
door went he, and away to the open country he
fled, as if the hounds of justice were upon his
heels. The Clerk of the Court and the Sheriff
hastened to assist their superior to an upright
position, and he showed his gratitude by getting
hold of the mallet and almost cracking the table
in his efforts to bring about order in that Court,
while he glared at his deputies.
</p>

<p>Then scowling fiercely upon the two lawyers
who had been the cause of his nap, he thundered:
“The case is dismissed! No cause.”
</p>

<p>The spectators laughed and jeered, and the two
legal representatives shook hands and departed.
Once outside, Jack and the lieutenant met again,
and the former said to the latter: “The whole
thing looked as if it had been staged for our
benefit.”
</p>

<p>And the army officer replied: “That’s a typical
scene of a trial for petty larceny. There is no
more apparent justice in the entire proceedings
than you would find in having your hen-coop
robbed and then have the man come and ask you
to give him the side trimmings to his chicken
dinner.”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken now came up and was introduced
to the officer. “Did the poor rascal really steal
the sugar-stick?” asked he.
</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, sir. But a lawyer with no
cases on hand has to trump up something to advertise
himself. He may have paid the old peddler
a little sum to attend the court and demand
a bit of justice. He may even have paid Al to
permit himself to be tried for stealing, provided
Al made the lawyer promise to get him scot free
at the last.”
</p>

<p>“Well, well! That scene was certainly well
worth the time it took to witness it!” added Mr.
Dalken, as they all moved away to the tram-cars.
</p>

<p>Later that morning Polly said: “I haven’t a
very high opinion of Kingston justice!”
</p>

<p>“I should say not!” exclaimed Eleanor in high
contempt.
</p>

<p>“If they bungle such little cases so badly, what
must they do when a really serious crime is committed?”
wondered Nancy.
</p>

<p>“I suppose they call in New York lawyers for
such cases,” laughed Polly, winking at Mr. Dalken
who stood with his back to the girls. But he
turned at this and retorted:
</p>

<p>“They never have really serious cases in Jamaica.
I find from the records that Jamaicans
are truly a law-abiding people who seldom commit
a crime which necessitates such condemnation
as we in New York have to administer.”
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chX'>CHAPTER X—SPORTS AT JAMAICA</h1>

<p>That afternoon after luncheon Mr. Dalken
proposed a trip to Spanish Town. He suggested
the yacht for the conveyance and an anchorage at
the quay over night in order to allow themselves
a full day at that beautiful settlement. As nothing
more exciting had been heard of, the younger
members of the party agreed to the plan.
</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, therefore, the White
Crest dropped anchor at that part of the Rio
Cobra River where Spanish Town is located.
The tourists remained on board the yacht that
night, but in the early morning they started to go
ashore in the two small launches belonging to the
yacht.
</p>

<p>As the boats neared the quay, the eager, waiting
urchins on the wharf stood ready to dive in
the waters for the coin they expected from the
white visitors. Nor were they disappointed.
</p>

<p>The passengers in both small boats tossed coins
out for the gamins to go after, and there, without
fear or thought of the ever-present shark, the diving
boys would go down in the waters to the bottom,
but more often they would catch the coin
even before it had time to reach the sandy bottom
of the water. It was a most amazing thing to
watch the speed and alertness of these children
who seemed automatic in their instantaneous dive
the moment the hand let go the coin.
</p>

<p>In several instances the boys caught the coin
in their hands just as it splashed into the surface
of the water. When the girls had tired of watching
this performance, the sailors were told to
move on to land.
</p>

<p>The hotel accommodations at Spanish Town
were not to be compared to the Spring Hotel at
Kingston; but they would have the yacht to use if
matters were too, uncomfortable at the hotel in
Spanish Town.
</p>

<p>Soon after landing at Spanish Town the men
heard of the excellent fishing to be had in the Rio
Cobra River, hence they hoped to try a catch
that day. But the ladies had also heard of the
beauty of Bog Walk, and they clamored to go
with the men. That necessitated a string of punts
and men to pole, but expense was no drawback
on this excursion. Moreover, Jamaican blacks
work for a mere nothing in comparison with New
York laborers.
</p>

<p>Down the shores of the Rio Cobra went the
flat punts and then drifted along the famous Bog
Walk, the passengers listening to the songs of the
tropical birds, and watching the verdure clad
shores—clad in palms, tall cane, or heavy bamboo
clumps. Both banks were carpeted with perfumed
and gaudy flowers, and the breeze stirred
lazily through the reeds and grasses along the
edge of the water where one could see the clumsy
tortoise, or swift water-rats moving about.
</p>

<p>As she sat in the bow of one of the punts Polly
called the attention of Eleanor to a great bulky
tortoise. “Isn’t he ugly? Would you believe
that such beautiful things as our tortoise-shell
toilet articles could ever come from that filthy
back?”
</p>

<p>“It looks like a scum-covered bit of wreckage
from the sea!” declared Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“There goes one,—swimming down the
stream!” called Nancy.
</p>

<p>The girls looked and sure enough! A mud-covered
projection floated past while the weeds
which grow from the crevices in the back of the
shell, trailed behind him like dank strips of string.
</p>

<p>The men in the other punts saw the tortoise
and this brought forth a suggestion that they enjoy
a day’s turtle fishing while they tarried at
Jamaica. Nothing loth, Jack urged Mr. Dalken
to accept the offer.
</p>

<p>Hunting the turtle is a varied sport, according
to the energy and sportsmanship of the hunter.
The easiest way is that pursued by men who wish
to use the least power and run the least risk of
danger to themselves. These men catch the
female just after she has deposited her eggs on a
muddy river bank. They turn her over on her
back and render her helpless until they come to
drag her to the pens where they keep them until
exported.
</p>

<p>Other hunters spear the turtles in the open sea,
and this is really the most daring of the hunt, as
often a turtle will suddenly make a swift run to
the open sea and drag a harpoon in its track.
</p>

<p>But the method mostly followed is that of snaring
the creatures in nets when they rise to the surface
for breath. The men of Jamaica are experienced
turtle hunters, and they follow the net
method.
</p>

<p>Early at dawn, the following morning, the Captain
called Mr. Dalken and said the turtle fishermen
were alongside waiting for them to go out to
fish. No need of calling twice! Jack Baxter and
Ray jumped into old clothes and in an incredibly
short time were on deck, the three elder men in
the party soon followed, and then the natives
made room for their employees. But the Captain
had taken orders from Mr. Dalken to slowly
follow in the wake of the boats, in order to give
the ladies an opportunity to watch the hunting.
</p>

<p>Breakfast was quite neglected that morning because
the girls were engaged in watching the
sport. From the vantage point of the higher elevation
on the yacht they could watch all without
any trouble whatever.
</p>

<p>There seemed to be quite a fleet of boats, all
of which were built by the natives. The turtle
nets were woven of the leaves of the thatch-palm.
The leaf is denuded and the membrane thus left
is twisted into almost unbreakable fibrous cords.
When dried, this mesh would have held the most
powerful fish caught in its net.
</p>

<p>There was intense excitement when one of the
men in a boat sighted a deep-sea turtle. Then
the others all followed carefully the directions of
the leader in his boat. They came up to the
quarry in a semi-circle, dragging the great net as
they approached in shallow water.
</p>

<p>Suddenly the watchers on the yacht saw the
heavy net cast and immediately a desperate
thrashing and flopping of about three hundred
pounds of turtle began. The water was lashed
to a foam and one boat was completely capsized
by a fin that struck its side.
</p>

<p>Finally the men manipulated the net in such a
way that the great turtle was turned over upon
his back; then the flapping of fins, each stronger
than a flail, accompanied by the uncanny sort of
moaning from the reptile, caused vague sympathy
from the watchers on the yacht.
</p>

<p>The great creature was dragged in the net by
the last boat in the line, and after strenuous effort
was left in the deep-sea pool off the quay. A
quantity of turtle grass was left for the reptile
to feed upon, and the sport for that time was over—all
but the paying off of the natives who had
staged the play.
</p>

<p>These same natives had induced Mr. Dalken
and his friends to consider a day’s hunting in the
alligator swamps just off the Rio Cobra River.
The ladies could not possibly take part in this
dangerous sport—not so dangerous from the jaws
of the alligators as from the dreaded miasma
which is continually rising from the hotbeds of
typhoid-malarial scums.
</p>

<p>All the warnings and beseechings, to say nothing
of the threats, from the wives of two of the
men proved to be of any avail. They were determined
to go!
</p>

<p>When it was found that all prayers left the
male contingent of the yachting party as hard as
flint toward any proposition of giving up the alligator
shooting, the ladies suddenly reversed their
opinions and did all possible to hasten the men
from the yacht.
</p>

<p>“They have some trick up their sleeves,” remarked
Mr. Ashby smilingly, to his companions.
</p>

<p>“You don’t think they plan to accompany us in
the yacht, do you?” questioned Mr. Dalken, anxiously.
“It would be a great hazard for them.”
</p>

<p>“No, not that; but there is no use in asking
them what is their plan because they would come
back with the counter proposition for us to remain
here and find out.”
</p>

<p>Hence the men in their oldest clothes with rubber
boots to their hips left the yacht. The slimy
marshes they would have to wade through would
necessitate the discard of any clothing after the
hunt ended.
</p>

<p>The alligator of the West Indies is half-brother
to the crocodile of Africa, though he is not as
large as the latter; still, he is large enough to
mutilate a man and quickly kill him. Hence the
sport is fraught with some danger as well as unpleasant
experiences from insects and the malarial
localities.
</p>

<p>The natives called at the yacht in a large open
boat something after the pattern of a northern
whaler. Having approved of the attire of the
yachtsmen, the guide started the craft for the
swamps. At the mouth of the Rio Cobra lay a
flat stretch of mud-colored sand with every now
and then a patch of bushes, scrub-trees and coarse
grass.
</p>

<p>“I suppose the reptiles sleep in those watery
places, which one can see glistening through the
swamp growth,” suggested Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>The guide of the party nodded and pointed at
what seemed afar to be a floating log. The Americans
looked intently and found the log had half-closed
eyes but an open mouth—open to catch
any wandering tidbit which might be attracted to
venture to that gate of sure death.
</p>

<p>“If only we were over there now—we’d bag
our first ’gator, eh?” said Jack, anxiously.
</p>

<p>“No, no, not him! He gone too queeck,” replied
the guide.
</p>

<p>The boat was anchored and the men climbed
out into water which reached to their waists.
Then the guide started out to divide the party into
units. He led the two young men as he must have
thought they needed more careful supervision
than the older and more reserved men in the
group.
</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Every known pest of an insect
must find its home in this swamp!” exclaimed
Ray, as he kept busily whipping away gnats,
midges, mosquitoes, and a myriad of other stinging
bugs.
</p>

<p>“Gee! Can’t say I care for this stench of rotting
wood and decayed vegetation,” laughed Jack,
wrinkling his nostrils to keep out the odor.
</p>

<p>Passing through evil-looking stretches of scum,
over rotting stumps, disturbing nests of plagues,
and causing swarms of stinging insects to cover
their hands and faces, the two young men finally
reached a spot where the guide suddenly halted.
</p>

<p>“Looka-dere!” he whispered, pointing to an up-thrust
of green filth and scum.
</p>

<p>Jack and Ray stared for a moment in sheer unbelief,
then they aimed, shot, and at the same instant
the sickening mass sunk, and all the hunters
could see was a cleavage of the surrounding slime.
</p>

<p>“Too late!” sighed the guide: “Him hear me
talk.”
</p>

<p>The three resumed their difficult progress
farther into the swamp, and then without notice
Jack lifted his rifle, aimed, and an explosion
echoed throughout the place. A great shower of
chips and bark rewarded this exploit, and the
guide laughed good-naturedly.
</p>

<p>“Him sure dead log!” remarked he to Jack’s
discomfiture.
</p>

<p>Finally they halted again and the guide silently
pointed to a smaller heap of scum quite close to
what looked like a great tree-trunk fallen over
into the water. Both boys aimed and shot at what
they believed to be a small alligator, and then to
their great amazement the <span class='it'>huge</span> log scuttled away,
while the small child of the immense mother followed
in her wake leaving a streak of crimson in
the stream to tell the hunters they had missed killing
him.
</p>

<p>“We go in here, sit down and watch. Mebbe
big ’gator come by.” Thus saying the guide
started for a screened spot in the marsh and
posted his followers upon a log which gave them
a good view of the surrounding area. He sat
upon the lower end of the tree.
</p>

<p>Jack looked carefully around, and Ray watched
a spot that made him think a submerged alligator
might rise up and offer him a good target. Jack
spied a vast depression in the mud bank near his
right hand, and the guide nodded.
</p>

<p>At the moment of Jack’s distraction and the
guide’s nod, Ray pulled the trigger of his gun and
the shot found a true result of that aim. A tiny
alligator came to the surface, half-turned over in
the coating of green, and gasped. At the same
time a maddened splashing came through the
green marsh-grass near the dying infant ’gator,
and soon an enormous head with snapping jaws
thrust itself from the water.
</p>

<p>The half-crazed mother used her snout to tenderly
go over the quivering body of her child, and
when she found it had breathed its last she lifted
the mud-crusted head and gazed balefully around.
</p>

<p>“Queeck! Queeck—shoot!” commanded the
guide, taking swift aim and firing a load at the
reptile. But his shot missed because the alligator
was thrashing too wildly across the water and
making for the hunters.
</p>

<p>Not ten yards separated the three men who
were doomed if they did not climb out of the reach
of those sinister jaws with their double rows of
long white teeth. Her eyes showed what the alligator
meant to do to the murderers of her child,
and the very twisting and lightning-like advance of
the huge thing sent a shiver of dread along the
spines of the two young hunters.
</p>

<p>Again the rifle of the guide cracked, and in another
moment the guns of the two Americans sent
forth their spurts of red and the yellow streaks
of death right into the opened jaws of the monster.
Still she came on and lifted her vast opened
jaw within a foot of Jack’s leg. The lashing tail
of the alligator was the only thing which told she
had been shot and was suffering.
</p>

<p>It would have been good-night for the hunter’s
leg had not the guide filled the forehead of the
reptile with shot—shot that entered between the
eyes and sank into the brain to paralyze further
designs on her enemies.
</p>

<p>With a mighty effort the huge creature lifted
herself half out of the water and flung herself far
from the log. The midstream silently covered
her with its green covering and the monster sank
from view.
</p>

<p>“Did we kill her?” nervously cried Jack.
</p>

<p>“Her gone! She die, but not here. Where she
go we no go!”
</p>

<p>“All right, then, I’m through hunting alligators.
After seeing the frantic grief and mother-love in
that awful thing’s eyes I could not aim at another
creature in this swamp. You go on with the
guide, Ray, but I’m through!” declared Jack.
</p>

<p>“I say the same, Jack. When you remember
the old reptile’s snout as she lovingly went over
the carcass of her young, it makes us seem like
brutes, even less soulful than the poor alligator.
Come on.”
</p>

<p>The guide smiled. He could not understand
such sentiments over a vile alligator, and he felt
that he had selected a pair of weak-kneed youths
to take into the swamp.
</p>

<p>“You not fraid of legs! I not let alligator bite
you, I swear!” exclaimed the guide, thinking they
were nervous at the close acquaintance with the
mother-’gator.
</p>

<p>But Jack took no trouble to explain. They motioned
the man to lead out, and shortly after the
incident had closed the three reached the sandy
shore where the boat had been anchored.
</p>

<p>In the heat of a tropical sun they ate a few rice-cakes
and drank warm water from the canteen,
but they had to wait for more than an hour before
the other hunters came back. Meanwhile the
guide had followed his own bent and had gone
back into the swamp to secure a trophy. Jack
was glad to find later that he had not seen a single
snout.
</p>

<p>The return trip was soon accomplished, but
when the boat came to the place where the yacht
had been last seen there was not a sign of the
White Crest.
</p>

<p>“Well, this is what they planned—to give us
the slip!” laughed Mr. Dalken, as he motioned
the men to keep on and land them on the wharf of
Spanish Town.
</p>

<p>The hunters returned earlier than had been
planned for, hence they had a tiresome wait at
Spanish Town for the appearance of the White
Crest once more. All they could learn by questioning
the loafers at the quay was the fact that
the yacht had sailed away. That was self-evident,
or else she had gone down. The latter was too
impossible for belief so she <span class='it'>must</span> have sailed away.
</p>

<p>Dinnertime came and passed, still no White
Crest. The darkness came over the water and
the squatty houses of Spanish Town, and still no
yacht. It was close to midnight when the impatient
watchers, seated on a crude plank on the
wharf, saw a beautiful silvery craft glide up to
the mouth of the river and silently drop her
anchor.
</p>

<p>“Well, there she is, but how are we to reach
her?” asked the owner, chewing the end of a
cigar.
</p>

<p>“We’ll halloo for the Captain to send us the
boat,” replied Jack, and immediately Ray and he
chorused a loud call for transportation over the
bay.
</p>

<p>The transfer was made and then, man-like, the
hunters all clamored for an explanation. “To
think of leaving us stranded all day and half the
night!” exclaimed Mr. Ashby.
</p>

<p>“We thought you planned to be hunting until
sundown,” said Mrs. Ashby.
</p>

<p>“And of course you would be worn out when
you got back and would appreciate a little quiet
on the quay,” added Mrs. Fabian, smilingly.
</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” demanded Jack.
</p>

<p>“We’ve been cooling our heels ever since four
o’clock.”
</p>

<p>“Perhaps we had the best time then,” said Mrs.
Courtney. “I certainly enjoyed myself immensely
to-day and this evening.”
</p>

<p>“We all did,” echoed her companions. “We
sailed all round Jamaica and saw sights which
you men would not bother to stop and appreciate.
We have seen the tiny palm-covered coral dots
which lift their heads above the rippling sea and
warn us to keep a keen watch for the reefs hidden
under the water. We have had pointed out to us
the great mountainsides where the three hundred
thousand black slaves climbed in order to face the
rising sun on the dawn of the day that witnessed
their emancipation. We got birdseye views of
the other towns on the Island of Jamaica—Port
Antonio, Montego Bay, and the smaller settlements
which dot the island like so many studs of
color. Oh, yes! we had a glorious sail—thanks to
our good Captain.”
</p>

<p>“And thanks to the good yacht,” laughed Mr.
Dalken.
</p>

<p>“We may as well add: thanks to Dalky and his
generous invitation to us,” concluded Polly.
</p>

<p>And to the latter motion every one called a
unanimous hurrah!
</p>

<p>The following day was given to visiting the
cathedral which is the oldest building on the
island. It can show an antiquity of four centuries
and withstood all battles for supremacy of
different factions and nations since 1523. Polly
and Eleanor went with Mr. Fabian and Mr.
Ashby to examine and study the old monuments,
the style of decoration, and the many other notable
points of interest to architects and decorators.
</p>

<p>Having ended this visit, the tourists returned
to the White Crest and sailed away, but to stop at
Hope Gardens—the Botanical Gardens and a
show-place of Jamaica. There were many other
places to be visited, a list of them showing that
some would have to be eliminated. So after “doing”
Belle View, Castleton, and Mandeville, the
entire party voted to say goodby to Jamaica, the
Queen of the Antilles, and continue on their
vagabondage.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI—MEETING OLD FRIENDS IN PANAMA</h1>

<p>After leaving Jamaica the Captain asked for
instructions as to the chosen direction and the next
stopping place.
</p>

<p>“Well, after once seeing Jamaica, I suppose we
have virtually seen every other island in the Caribbean
Group. The flowers, the climate, the natives,
even the employments are all similar if not
exactly alike. There is but one point of interest
that is not common to them all, and that is the
volcano of Mont Pelée on Martinique.
</p>

<p>“But volcanoes are no curiosity to Polly because
she lives in the crater of one of the largest extinct
volcanoes in the Rockies, so there is no
call for the White Crest to stop at Martinique
to show her Mont Pelée,” explained Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“Why not sail along past the different islands
of the archipelago and have a good look at them
from our comfortable deck chairs,” suggested
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>This proposition was received with approval
and the Captain was advised to steer a course as
close as practical to the coral formations, and,
those islands of volcanic structure, and permit the
tourists to see the Windward Islands without
troubling to go ashore.
</p>

<p>Hence the yacht, in its cruise, sailed past Porto
Rico, and the long string of tiny isles connecting
that important island with Barbados and Trinidad.
St. Lucia, Dominica, and Martinique were
left behind, and then the Captain changed his
course to a westward direction.
</p>

<p>Leaving Venezuela to the southward he
sped on for the Canal Zone. The plan originally
made in New York would then be followed
as closely as possible. At Colon the White
Crest would anchor until her passengers had
visited all that was to be in that town seen,
and then they would go through the great
locks of the Canal and eventually reach the Pacific
Ocean.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken and the Captain figured that a
week would be ample time in which to visit everything
and come out of the Canal to the Colombia
shore.  But they reckoned without the young
folks, as usual.
</p>

<p>Soon after the yacht had anchored at Colon,
the tourists started to visit the town. They had
not gone far before Jack discovered there would
be a great baseball match at the public park between
the United States army side and the Colon
players. His eye caught the names of two members
of the regiment stationed at Panama, and
he turned to show them to Ray.
</p>

<p>“Could it possibly be Bill Ainslee and Bob
Madden of the A. E. F. in France?”
</p>

<p>“I did hear something about Bill remaining
with the regulars to try South America. We
can’t lose out by introducing ourselves, anyway,
and ten to one the boys will turn out to be our old
Buddies,” said Ray.
</p>

<p>The proposition was made and accepted to go
and see the ball game late that afternoon; the
girls felt as much interest in knowing whether or
not the two soldiers at Panama were the ones
Jack believed them to be.
</p>

<p>No sooner was the Dalken party seated in the
Grand Stand, than Jack and Ray hurried away.
They were gone a long time, and the eager spectators
on the bleachers as well as those in the
Grand Stand, had to call and show impatience at
the delay of the opening of the game before the
teams came out.
</p>

<p>Jack and Ray returned to their friends on the
Grand Stand. One glance at their smiling faces
told the girls that they had found pals. Jack
was bubbling over with pleasure at the meeting
and the plans they had made for a good time during
the visit at Panama.
</p>

<p>“Gee! Bill looks great! He was so white and
thin in the trenches over there, but now he has
filled out and looks wonderful. I never dreamed
he would turn out to be so handsome, did you,
Ray?”
</p>

<p>“No, but then Bob isn’t far behind in looks.
It must be this climate that tans them to such a
glorious shade,” said Ray.
</p>

<p>“There are other things than tan that this
climate does to one,” remarked Mr. Dalken,
briefly. The boys laughed and agreed with him.
</p>

<p>“For instance, malaria caught while alligator
hunting,” said Mrs. Fabian, because she had
heard the men discussing the possibility of their
tired feeling being the result of the swamp visit.
</p>

<p>The game now opened and the girls were all
eyes and interest to see the Panama team win,
because Jack happened to know two of the players.
Whether it was the knowledge that four
pretty girls were seated in the Grand Stand
watching, or whether it was their usual manner
of pitching and batting, the fact remains that Bill
and Bob were the champion members of the team
that day, and carried away the honors.
</p>

<p>After the game ended the two crack players
changed their togs and reappeared in uniform.
Jack met them and escorted them to meet Mr.
Dalken’s party. Then Polly saw that Jack had
not exaggerated one bit when he had declared his
two friends to be decidedly good looking.
</p>

<p>“My! They’re more than that, Poll,” whispered
Eleanor, in breathless admiration. “I think
Bill is just too dear for anything.”
</p>

<p>Ray overheard her remark. He grinned teasingly
and said: “It’s the uniform, my dear child!
If Bob or Bill wore a bell boy’s uniform, they’d
look just as good, but you wouldn’t think so.”
</p>

<p>“Pooh! No such thing!” exclaimed Eleanor,
shrugging her pretty shoulders at Ray.
</p>

<p>“Well, here is Jack and here am I, and I’m
sure we are not bad looking, yet you never said
you thought me ‘too dear for anything,’” complained
Ray.
</p>

<p>“How could I speak an untruth?” retorted
Eleanor, laughing.
</p>

<p>“All right for you! I’ll spy upon you after this
and when I find you enjoying a tête-à-tête with a
‘dear for anything boy’ I’ll spoil it—see if I
don’t!” Ray threatened but the girls knew he
cared not a fig whether they thought him handsome
or not. He was all for a good time and
that was the end of his ambitions.
</p>

<p>“Ray, you don’t stand a ghost of a show in the
running with Bill or Bob,” declared Jack. “Bill
with his French Medal and Bob with his Decoration
for Bravery simply put us out of sight when
the girls are on hand to offer adulation at the
shrines of these heroes.”
</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! Tell us—are the two baseball
players great heroes of the late war?” exclaimed
Mrs. Courtney, eagerly.
</p>

<p>“There now! Didn’t I tell you so!” laughed
Jack, winking at his chum. “Even the adult admirers
forget we are on earth the moment one
mentions Bill and Bob.”
</p>

<p>“Please, oh, <span class='it'>please</span>, Jack, tell us the story of,
what they did over there,” beseeched Polly.
</p>

<p>“If I were to tell you that tale I’d spoil it in the
telling. Better ask Bill and Bob to tell their own
thrillers,—if you really want to hear something
that will compare favorably with those hair-raising
experiences on Grizzly Slide,” replied Jack,
earnestly.
</p>

<p>During this little side-gossip the two victors in
the recent contest with the Colon players, were
engaged in talking to Mr. Dalken. Now they
turned and addressed Jack.
</p>

<p>“Mr. Dalken wishes us to dine on the yacht,
but we shall have to ask permission to do that.
I only wish we had a pull with some one, in order
to get several days off. Then we could show you
about in great style!” Bill kept his eyes fixed
upon Polly as he spoke, and any one might think
he was addressing her only. Eleanor smiled, but
she had failed to turn and look at Bill’s companion.
It was Nancy and Ruth who had to smile
now at the attentive manner in which Bob stared
at pretty Eleanor, totally oblivious of the other
girls in the party.
</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Ainslee, Dalky here is the professional
wire-puller of North America—didn’t you
know that? I’m sure he can find a string that
will work for you,” laughed Polly.
</p>

<p>“Tell me the names of the officers in your regiment,
Ainslee, and let me see if I know them,”
added Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“There now! Didn’t I tell you he could work
it?” laughed Polly, while the other members in
the group also laughed at their host’s quick acceptance
of the suggestion.
</p>

<p>Having mentioned the various officers and
spoken of their individual tendencies, Mr. Dalken
smiled wisely. “Leave the whole matter to me,
boys, and we will win out.”
</p>

<p>“Tell us, Dalky! What can you do about tonight?”
asked the girls eagerly.
</p>

<p>“For to-night, I propose having all the officers
<span class='it'>and</span> the two heroes of the ball game on the yacht
to dinner. They cannot very well say no to Bill
and Bob if they accept for themselves, can they?”
</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Dalky! If you plan to have a
dinner party it is high time we all ran away to
prepare for the social event,” declared Mrs.
Courtney. This was the first time she had ever
used the familiar name the girls had given Mr.
Dalken, but it did not escape Polly’s notice. She
gave Eleanor a glance, but Eleanor had been too
interested in learning the outcome of the proposition
made by Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest hope that our invitation
will be accepted for this evening, as in all
probability the officers have made other engagements
for dinner. But it paves the way for me
to urge them to give Bill and Bob leave of absence
for to-night. Then I will invite the men
who cannot come to-night, to come as soon as they
can make the date. I believe I have a speaking
acquaintance with the Colonel and I hope to improve
our acquaintance while we stop here—then
you girls ought to be able to make the most of this
opportunity by winning a few days’ vacation for
Bill and Bob.”
</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Eleanor, clapping her hands.
“Now you three men hurry away and see the
Colonel.”
</p>

<p>Bill and Bob looked at Mr. Dalken and, seeing
he was willing to accompany them, they politely
said good-afternoon to the other members
in the party and stood ready to go.
</p>

<p>“There may be strength in numbers, and we
are glad to go with you,” hinted Jack, linking an
arm in that of Ray and stepping up beside the host.
</p>

<p>“As far as strength goes I always favor pretty
girls for power when one has to use diplomacy
and cunning,” laughed Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“Not in this case, however,” retorted Bill. “If
our Colonel knew the danger we boys were running
by volunteering to walk right up before the
ammunition of beauty, he’d never let us out of his
sight.”
</p>

<p>“Ha! Mr. Ainslee discovered other things in
France besides medals for bravery!” laughed
Mrs. Courtney, shaking a playful finger at him.
</p>

<p>“Medals! Who told you anything about
medals?” asked Bill, with genuine amazement in
his voice.
</p>

<p>“A little bird whispered it at my ear,” laughed
Mrs. Courtney teasingly.
</p>

<p>“I know the bird! We always thought it was
a raven over there—from the way he croaked
whenever he had to eat army mess,” was the
humorous reply from Bill.
</p>

<p>Midst the general laugh at Jack’s expense
which followed Bill’s speech, the men left and
walked in the direction of the waiting automobile
which had been placed at the ball-players’ disposal
for the day.
</p>

<p>Polly turned to her friends and said: “Oh, I’m
sure Dalky will succeed in getting them off for a
few days. I really believe Dalky can do <span class='it'>anything</span>!”
</p>

<p>Eleanor glanced at Mrs. Courtney as Polly
spoke, and caught a puzzling expression which
had flashed over that lady’s face. In a moment,
however, she was as inscrutable as ever she cared
to appear.
</p>

<p>“We may as well go into this shop and have a
lemonade while we are waiting for the returns of
the election,” suggested Mr. Ashby.
</p>

<p>“Do you think it will take the boys very long to
find the officer who can permit them to get off tonight?”
asked Polly.
</p>

<p>“I have an idea that Bill will know exactly
where to find his superiors and not more than half
an hour should elapse before they will come
back,” returned Mr. Ashby, glancing at his watch.
</p>

<p>“I was about to say—that we should have
gone on to the yacht and dressed for to-night,
if they are to be gone as long as that,” ventured
Polly.
</p>

<p>“I tell you what we might do!” cried Eleanor,
plumping her glass upon the marble slab with such
emphasis that the lemonade spattered up and over
her hands. “Leave Mr. Fabian and Mr. Ashby
at this corner so the others can see them upon
their return, and we ladies go on to the yacht and
touch up for the evening’s fray.”
</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was about to say,” added
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“Where’s the fray? You ladies never thought
the superior faction of this yachting party worthy
of captivation before,” remarked Mr. Fabian
cynically, albeit he smiled.
</p>

<p>“I should say not! Two old married fogies,
two harum-scarum boys, and a grass-widower!”
exclaimed Nancy Fabian.
</p>

<p>A general laugh rewarded Nancy’s retort, and
Mr. Ashby held up both hands in a helpless manner.
“Oh, for pity’s sake, go—GO and touch up
for the young men, or Fabian and I shall have to
crawl under the soda fountain to escape your
wit!”
</p>

<p>The girls started up at that and the ladies followed
laughingly; soon they were out of sight on
their way to the White Crest and an elaborate
toilette for the dinner party that night.
</p>

<p>“Some one ought to let the chef know Dalky
expects to bring back guests for dinner,” ventured
Polly to Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“I think orders have been given,” replied she
in a quiet tone.
</p>

<p>“Why! How did Dalky know we expected to
meet the boys whom Jack and Ray knew in
France?” asked Polly, in astonishment.
</p>

<p>“He didn’t. But he did say that he thought it
would be very pleasant to have us meet the officers
of the Post stationed at the Canal. It
was his intention to invite them to dine at their
first opportunity. Hence he left orders for
the chef to prepare for extra plates every
evening while we are here,” explained Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be fine!” exclaimed Polly, but
Eleanor wondered if Mrs. Fabian and Mrs.
Ashby, as well as Mrs. Courtney, knew of this
arrangement.
</p>

<p>Long before the females in the party came
from their rooms robed in such becoming gowns
as would distract any young man who, because of
army discipline, had not had many opportunities
to enjoy society, the men came on board and, by
the hilarious manner of their conversation, suggested
that <span class='it'>apparently</span> they had celebrated the
victory of the Army baseball players in a social
drink of native wine. But this was not the case.
Sheer exuberance of spirits, natural not fermented,
made the four boys who had known each
other in France, bubble over and sparkle with wit
and fun.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken invited Bill and Bob to amuse
themselves on deck while he and his male guests
retired and dressed for dinner. Hence the two
young men were lounging in the great reed chairs
when Polly and Eleanor appeared. There was no
time for a little flirtation, however, as Mrs.
Courtney came out, looking magnificent in an
American Beauty georgette gown, with her diamond
neck-band and pendant earrings sparkling
from throat and ears. Polly gazed in appreciative
admiration at the combination of dark wavy
hair, high-colored complexion, and brilliant brown
eyes, with the rich crimson of the dress and the
cold white of the diamonds.
</p>

<p>Soon after this the other ladies joined the
group on deck and finally the men came forth in
their somber black dinner coats and immaculate
white collars and cuffs. Jack came puffing and
fanning himself with his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>“Well, you girls ought to pay us a tribute for
willingly going to the torture chair to-night. Stiff
collars and heavy cloth coats on a torrid night as
this in the Canal Zone!”
</p>

<p>“Nobody asked you to!” retorted Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but we knew what we would get
if we appeared in the lists, with our friends here
in their uniform, and the rest of us in our tropical
togs,” returned Jack.
</p>

<p>“Oh, then it is mere pride that drove you to
the deed?” asked Polly.
</p>

<p>“No, it was desperate fear!” exclaimed Ray.
“What chance would we stand with a bevy of
wonderful orchids and two dazzling hummingbirds—meaning
Bill and Bob, of course,—if we
looked like sparrows from the city streets?”
</p>

<p>Every one laughed. “Orchids are too good to
be forgotten,” added Polly; “every time I see an
orchid hereafter I shall remember that, for once
in my lifetime, I was compared to the rare and
beautiful flower.”
</p>

<p>“Rare in New York, perhaps, but anything but
rare down here!” retorted Jack.
</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! Why spoil such a lovely compliment
with the truth,” remonstrated Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>The constant teasing and darts of wit between
Jack and Ray on the one side and Polly and
Eleanor on the other, had been one source of
amusement and perpetual fun for the tourists in
Mr. Dalken’s party, and now that Bill and Bob
had joined the others on deck that night, the quick
repartee seemed tossed back and forth like a
tennis ball between clever players.
</p>

<p>A man servant now came over to announce dinner,
and then, for the first time, Polly realized
that the officers who were to be invited to dinner
had not appeared.
</p>

<p>“Where is the Colonel, Dalky?” asked she,
wonderingly.
</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find him anywhere, but I secured the
acceptance of the other officers for dinner to-morrow
night,” explained he.
</p>

<p>“You did more than that, Dalky!” declared
Jack, with a delighted glance at Bill and Bob.
“You got the boys three days’ leave while we are
stationed here.”
</p>

<p>“Oh, really! Goody, goody!” cried several
young voices in a chorus of joy.
</p>

<p>“And an invitation for all to attend the usual
weekly hop to-morrow night, but I can’t see for
the life of me how any one can dance with the thermometer
pushing the top of the mercury out of
the tube,” grumbled Jack.
</p>

<p>“Listen to him! Any one would think he isn’t
the maddest one of the group when dancing is to
be had!” laughed Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>After finishing the first course, the host turned
to his two new guests and said: “We are on the
griddle for the tale of your experiences in France,
boys. I know the girls have had difficulty in curbing
their feminine curiosity to hear of your
exploits.”
</p>

<p>Both young men flushed, but Bob managed to
say: “Bill, here, is the crack story-teller. I always
take a back seat when he is on hand to do
the honors for both.”
</p>

<p>Therefore Bill was deluged with demands for
the story, and having cleared his throat in a self-conscious
way, he began.
</p>

<p>But his preparations were ruined at that moment,
when the Belgian lad on the yacht, now unexpectedly
introduced a diversion. He had approached
with a laden tray, in order to assist the
man servant who had charge of the dinner party,
but when he saw the two young men in uniform, he
immediately sat the tray upon the floor and ran
over to fall upon Bill’s neck.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII—THE TALE TOLD BY THE BELGIAN</h1>

<p>“Agh, mine goot savior! Mine beeg fine
frent! I feel so full to choy dat I must cry!”
The Belgian acted exactly like an overjoyed mastiff
when his master returns from a long absence.
</p>

<p>“Why, Johann! This <span class='it'>is</span> a surprise,” cried Bob,
rising from his chair and joining Bill who still
remained pinned in the arms of the happy
foreigner.
</p>

<p>The others in the party at the dinner table
watched with amazement as the little tableaux
came to a finish.
</p>

<p>“Now that Johann is on the stage, it is most
appropriate that he tell the story of our adventures
in France. For, be it known to all present,
Jo was with us when we first went over with the
Canadian boys, and it was Jo’s mother who
nursed me after I got away from the Hun temporary
prison in Belgium.”
</p>

<p>Bill now turned to Johann and made him understand
that he was to tell those around the table
of the adventures of the three buddies. Mr. Dalken
immediately placed a chair for Johann, but
that worthy felt he could talk louder and gesticulate
better if he stood upon his long staunch legs.
</p>

<p>“Agh! Dat wass beeg times—ven we fight so
fine for my countree, eh? But now—agh! poor
Johann iss no more dan a keetchen boy.”
</p>

<p>The great big fellow shook his head despairingly
and had it not been that he was deadly in
earnest over the complaint, his audience would
have laughed at such a dire circumstance as his
being a kitchen boy.
</p>

<p>“Yah! I tells dat story fine, Beel! Now hear
me: Von day in ver early morning, I am sent to
find someting to eat fer my mudder and seek seester.
I like to belong to a solger’s life but eferyone
say I too younk and I got’ta tak care ofer
my family. Dis time I hear one farmer got a
beeg peeg what he not like the Huns to eat, and
he sent me vord to come carry him off and help
to keel him.
</p>

<p>“Veil, I go so far on one road dat I think pretty
soon thet farm he come up and show himself, but
I finds onny black smokin’ ruins wherever I go.
When I think I been gone far enough on one road
I say to myself: ‘Jo, now go dis way—mebbe dat
man live down dis way.’ I take him. But I not
find a farm—I find plenty Huns what sit and laff
and eat pork what dey fry ofer a wood fire.
</p>

<p>“I smell dat pork and I know now dey eat dat
peeg what my farmer fren send vord to me to
come keel for my mudder. So I go right up to
dem six fat enemy, and I speak right out in him
face and tell him what I feel. Mebbe dey don’t
laff so much at me dat one man he say: ‘Ketch
him and slit his gullet. He make a fine beeg dinner
next time we eat!’
</p>

<p>“Veil, and so, anudder Hun come ofer and
stick out a hand to hoi’ my arm, but I shake him
off like I feel he insult me. Den one fat feller
what looks like a boss, calls out for him to put me
in the peegpen where two more prisoners they
keep.
</p>

<p>“Queeck like anything four Huns ketch hold
on me and push me in a leetle pen where I see
here my good fren’ Beel and my nudder fine fren’
Bob. We tree mus’ live in a peeg pen all night,
and nex’ day dose fat enemy tink to take us to a
prison in heem own countree. But I tink difrunt.
</p>

<p>“I say to Beel here, ‘Six Huns, tree white man.
Six what so fat dey no jump, and tree of us what
lean like famine.’ But we got good arm, and we
stay in dat peeg pen all night and fix up sometings
what make our enemy fall down er run like
nudding.
</p>

<p>“All night we vork and pull old wood from
dat peeg pen and viles our enemy sleep we fix up
our cloobs. I mix oop so much peeg-mud in big
cannon balls like anyt’ing, and Beel he laffs so
much he falls down. Bob here he not laff so
much but he grin all over cause we got such a
fine way to shoot dem enemy and run away.
</p>

<p>“Veil, Beel say dis Hun bunch what he call
foratch scouts—dem what should go out and
bring in eat stuff. But dis crowd sit and eat what
dey find, and so mebbe dey got’ta go back in the
morning. Anyway, I hear the boss say late dat
night, ‘You two go back and report in the mornin’—no
food yet. We four go on and keep huntin’
for more. See!’
</p>

<p>“Yes, two men see, and I see, too! Dat’s ven
I tell my plans and we vork hard all night.
</p>

<p>“Pretty soon, when daylight comes ofer the
sky, two men hurry off, and leaves four enemy to
me. I got efery plan fixt so I tel Beel and Bob
to be retty to hit dem cloobs hard, soon as I fire
my soft mud-balls right in dem beeg fat faces of
dem Chermans. Den I fixes plenty soft—ah,
so soft—peeg-pen dirt-balls on my left arm, and
I comes out sofly to where the Boss rolls on the
grass asleep, and I stuff most his face and his
mout’ all full of peeg-mud. Same time I fire mud-bullets
all in the face of dem udder tree solgers,
whiles Beel and Bob come right off me and whack!
Bang! down coom dem peeg cloobs on top off
dose Hun’s heads. One, two, fall down on the
ground, and the Boss he got what Beel calls
bracelets put on his hands, queeck. Bob he find
dem right by the side of dat Boss, so he use ’em
right!
</p>

<p>“Veil, one man what stands oop, and dat Boss,
we mek to walk queeck—oh so queeck—for the
army what sits off away from the Hun side. And
pooty soon, we march ofer No Man lant and Beel
yell like he was mad. Eferybody mek such a
beeg time ofer me, and Beel and Bob say I must
go to tell the Capataine all about dem peeg mud-shots.
So we go and Capataine laff, oh he laff,
and he say: ‘Give Johann all the food he can take
to his family.’
</p>

<p>“But I say: ‘Agh, no, Mr. Capataine! All dem
enemy now like to ketch Jo and find out how to
mek peeg cannons, and I nefer again see my
seester and mudder. Mebbe I like much better
to dress oop like my seester and ride back to home
in a peasant cart, yes?’
</p>

<p>“Efery body laff again and say yes. So I find
Beel here to go to get me a gurl’s dress, and I put
him on. But Jo not so beeg den as now, and dat
dress go on pooty goot, eh, Beel?”
</p>

<p>Thus appealed to Bill agreed, but the hardly
controlled laughter of the audience now pealed
forth and the narrator could not be heard for a
few moments. Then he resumed his tale.
</p>

<p>“All right! Beel and Bob find me a seat in a
Belgium peasant cart what drivin’ back home, and
I sit like a nice beeg gurl on a seat and call her
mudder. I find goot luck dat time, cause no Hun
stop me and no one take the beeg dinner what
Capataine pack for my family.
</p>

<p>“Mebbe my mudder not cry tears for joy when
I come in all dressed oop like my seester, and
my seester she laff and say: ‘Now I got a fine new
dress to wear.’
</p>

<p>“Veil, I tell my mudder I got’ta go join Beel’s
friend’s in dis fight. I find I beeg enuff to take
prisoner by my enemy, so I beeg enuff to fight,
too! My mudder cry, and my seester say. ‘Oh,
vere shall we find help?’ En I say: ‘Leaf this old
house ’cause soon it make fire for my enemy to
cook peegs, and you run so fast what you can to
my onkel’s in Bruges.’ So dey run an’ I coom
back to fight wid Beel. And so dat’s all.”
</p>

<p>As he concluded his story, Johann instantly
stooped and took the abandoned tray. He
quickly transferred its contents to the table and
turned to hurry back to the kitchen without waiting
for applause from his interested audience.
At the same moment the Oriental chef came down
the deck and brandished a long wooden spoon.
Johann saw and grinned. He half turned to Mr.
Dalken and said in a most laughable way: “My
enemy cooms!”
</p>

<p>Then he scuttled away down the other side of
the craft, and the chef stood and shook an angry
fist in his direction. But the Oriental heard the
loud laughter from those seated at table, and saw
their pleased faces and he surmised that Johann
must have been the cause of it. Hence he hurried
back to his culinary heaven to question the
servant and learn what had so amused the guests.
</p>

<p>“Jo hasn’t told half the story,” declared Bob,
as the merry laughter subsided.
</p>

<p>“No, he skipped anything that went to tell you
what a loyal man he was, and how he fought for
country as well as for us, his friends.” Bill
seemed to go back and mentally review the incidents.
</p>

<p>“Then it is up to you to tell us, Bill,” said Jack.
</p>

<p>“Perhaps we have a hero with us who should
have had a decoration. I believe in giving honor
where honor is due, and Jo shall have everything
that’s coming to him,” said Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“Well, the Croix de Guerre which I wear belongs
to Jo, according to all rules of the game,
but it fell to my lot to get it, and to Jo’s lot to
get the shell in his leg,” said Bill. This caused
a demand for the story, and Bill began.
</p>

<p>“Bob and I volunteered at midnight to hunt on
No Man’s Land for the officer who had important
orders in the breast pocket of his uniform.
He went out that afternoon with his men but was
reported missing upon our return. No one saw
him fall, nor had he been seen captured by the
enemy with whom we had a mix-up. This was
soon after Jo returned from home to link his
future with that of the Canadian Troops.
</p>

<p>“We managed to crawl unseen all over the
same ground where we had the skirmish late that
afternoon, but not a sign of the lieutenant could
we see. Finally Bob lifted his head and nodded
at what had seemed to me to be a heap of debris.
</p>

<p>“‘It’s a ruin,’ whispered Bob. ‘I don’t remember
seeing it there this evening.’
</p>

<p>“‘You didn’t, Bob. It was a little barn when
last we came out here,’ replied I.
</p>

<p>“‘Then a shell must have smashed it since.
Could the Left, have been near it, do you think?’
Bob’s tone suggested possibilities, so I silently
agreed to follow him.
</p>

<p>“We crept along, slowly and carefully, fearful
of a surprise at any moment, for the enemy were
out that night as well as others, and they might
be seeking in this ruin, exactly as we purposed to
seek for missing pals.
</p>

<p>“We reached the heap of stones and plaster
without interruption and then we felt we could
breathe better. The barn fell so that some of
the timbers caught in the ends of others and stuck
up after the manner of loose jack straws. Under
this small hollow pyramid was enough shelter for
both of us, and we crept there hoping to hide and
plan our return.
</p>

<p>“To my horror I came in contact with a cold
face, and after discreetly feeling over the body I
found it to be a Hun. We heaved a sigh of
relief to find it was not our Lefty. But close upon
that relief came a shock: A groan from under
the timbers.
</p>

<p>“‘Look out for a surprise!’ warned Bob, and
I nodded.
</p>

<p>“But we had no time to lose in wariness, for
immediately after the moan we heard a German
cursing fluently. The voice was not the same. I
soon made my way into the impromptu cave and
there discovered our officer, pinned down by a
timber and quite unconscious. It was his moan
we had heard. Almost within arm’s reach of him,
the Hun soldier was pinned down also, but he
could not move his body even though he was mad
to drive his spike into our Lefty’s unconscious
heart.
</p>

<p>“In a few shakes we had the German tied securely
and the timbers lifted from our officer.
Then we planned to return with the injured man
upon our backs. The enemy we were hoping to
drive before us into camp, but he objected so
strenuously that we feared detection if we insisted.
It was more important to get the officer
back and leave the Hun. Yet we did not care to
murder him in cold blood, and he refused to go
quietly. We decided to bang him over the head
with one of the logs, and when senseless we could
drag him after us. Even this seemed unnecessary
risk at the time, so we made him understand that
we would shoot him down in his track if he refused
to creep ahead of us as commanded. He
knew that he ran the danger of fire from both
sides should we be discovered on No Man’s Land,
yet he was daring enough the moment we had
started on our way to try and expose us to that
double fire. In fact, he figured that there would
be but one German less if all were killed, but
there would be three men of his enemy’s side lost.
But he failed in his little plot.
</p>

<p>“We had not advanced ten feet, I was carrying
the officer upon my back as I managed to
worm my way after Bob, when we heard a small
unit of Germans coming from the other direction.
They, too, were creeping, creeping stealthily, in
order to find their lost companions. Fortunately,
we had gagged the Hun who went in advance of
me, and he could not shout, but he could kick up
such a racket on the ground with his feet that it
must attract attention in the stillness of the night.
</p>

<p>“That made Bob so mad that he stood right
up, grabbed the Hun and hustled him back again
to the ruin. I had no choice but to turn with my
load and return also. We had hardly reached
this comparative security when the Germans who
were out to find their comrades, heard us and
reached the spot we had just abandoned.
</p>

<p>“‘They’ll be in here next!’ whispered Bob.
‘Got your gun ready?’
</p>

<p>“I had placed the officer back under the low
shelter of the fallen timbers, and then roped the
Hun to a huge post, which had been a corner stud
of the barn, leaving the gag in his mouth; his
head and his arms secured, to prevent his chewing
the ropes or fumbling with his harness. Then I
took my station near the aperture by which any
one would have to enter the ruin. Bob squatted
on the other side of the heap.
</p>

<p>“We had not long to wait. In only too short
an interval, the heads of our enemy came into
view. They were not as circumspect as Bob and
I had been, for they did not advance with guns
cocked and ready, hence I found it an easy matter
to pluck the gun directly out of the hand of
the first comer. At the same moment, as if he
caught my idea, Bob fell upon him and closed his
mouth with a big flat hand. The surprised man
was so frightened that he forgot to yell for help,
and his other two comrades came on without
warning until it was too late to retreat.
</p>

<p>“The captured man did give a cry but it was
muffled and so unintelligible that his pals might
have taken it to come from prisoners he had
found within the ruin. But the two who followed
the first capture were alert, and poked the muzzles
of their rifles almost in my face without being
able to see what they were up against. I
dropped suddenly and rolled over against the hulk
of the man who came first. The blow against
his legs and in the pit of his stomach made him
double over me and go headlong into the Hun
who sat roped against the post. Instantly I was
on him and had him at a disadvantage. It took
but a jiffy to force back his arms and make him
let go his clutch on the gun. I laughed at the
simple task we had had, when right behind me
sounded the report of a rifle. It was so close to
my head that I jumped and let go the hold on my
prisoner.
</p>

<p>“But the bullet meant for me found its rest in
the German I had just released. He rolled over
with a groan, and I turned to fight the third man
whose gun I thought had fired at me. To my
astonishment I saw Johann in silent combat with
the enemy. He had crept in just in time to see
the Hun aim at me, and he had jumped the man
so unexpectedly that the rifle went off wild and
hit the wrong man.
</p>

<p>“In a few seconds we had all the prisoners
roped and willing to follow wherever we commanded—even
to the ends of the earth. And Jo
insisted upon taking our officer upon his own
broad back. We managed to secure the Lieutenant
to his back by means of bits of harness found
in the ruins of the old barn, and having secured
the important order in my own breast-pocket, we
started out, driving the four prisoners before us.
</p>

<p>“It was almost dawn when we reached our own
line, and great was the welcome we got as we
came in ‘bringing our sheaves with us.’ But, as
I say, Bob and I got the medals, for doing what
really Johann brought to a pass. Without his
presence at the very moment when he was needed
most, I would have been a dead man and Bob
would have been at the mercy of three lively
Huns. And it was Jo who turned the table for
us.”
</p>

<p>When Bill had finished his story, the girls
cheered for Jo. He was just approaching with
the next course, but when he saw all the eager
smiling faces turned his way, and realized that
Beel had told the story of the old ruins, he set
the heavy tray upon the seat of a chair and fled.
Scouts were sent to find him and bring him back,
but not a trace of him could they see. He had
found a better hiding place than his seester’s dress
in which he had travelled back to his home in Belgium
that day.
</p>

<p>“Well, let’s finish our dinner, children, and
then we will take up the hunt for Jo. It will be
better fun than hunting the slipper,” remarked
Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>The dinner continued merrily, every one pleased
at the discovery of a real hero on the crew of the
yacht, and Mr. Dalken pleased to hear of Jo’s
courage and simple childlike bravery without
thought of recompense. But he also had a plan.
</p>

<p>Later in the evening, while the young folks
were dancing and trying their best to forget the
warm climate of the Equator, Mr. Dalken slipped
away and remained absent for some time. He
had gone to find Jo and have a heart to heart talk
with him.
</p>

<p>Thus he learned that Jo had signed up to take
this voyage in order to earn more money to send
to his sister who now was in a French hospital
in the north of France, suffering from nervous
collapse and lack of nutrition. His aged mother
had died from exposure at the time the enemy
had swarmed over Belgium and had driven every
native forth from home and friends.
</p>

<p>“Well, Jo, I am going to communicate with a
relative who is doing reconstruction work in
France now, and I shall ask her to visit your sister
and see if she is able to travel. If she is I
shall send her the money to bring her over to you,
and henceforth you shall work for me—not for
the Captain, or the chef, or any other boss, but
for me. Do you like the plan?”
</p>

<p>Johann sat and stared for a few moments, then
he jumped up and shouted. “Do I like heem! Oh,
Meester Boss, I <span class='it'>love</span> heem! And my seek seester—ah,
I love you, Beeg Boss!” And to Mr. Dalken’s
astonishment Johann threw both arms about
his neck and wept tears of joy upon the nice black
dinner coat.
</p>

<p>But Mr. Dalken never mentioned this to
others, for he appreciated the embrace which
came spontaneously from the heart of this great
big giant of a young Belgian whose gratitude was
unbounded. And he took Johann’s hand and
shook it in a friendly way, to seal the compact.
Just as he ended the hand-shaking, the chef came
in.
</p>

<p>“O-oh, Hon’able Master, muchee warm t’night!
Most hon’able company feel plenty sweat mebbe—me
pour nice cool jlink, eh, Hon’able Boss?”
</p>

<p>“I wish you would, please, and throw in plenty
of ice,” laughed Mr. Dalken, turning and leaving
the little room.
</p>

<p>“Come, now, Mos’ Hon’able So’jer in French—pour
plenty ice for our Mos’ Hon’able Boss,”
commanded the chef, thus placing Johann upon
a pedestal from which he could look down upon
all the other members of the crew thenceforth
and forever. For the Oriental had heard the
story of the medals and bowed down in hero worship
and named Jo “Mos’ Hon’able Jo” thereafter.
To the delighted Belgian it was as acceptable
an honor as the medal was to “Beel.”
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII—HIGH LIFE AT THE CANAL</h1>

<p>After the first day at the Canal Zone, not one
member of Mr. Dalken’s party had time in which
to plan for anything beyond the Canal. Bill and
Bob returned late that first night and reported to
their companions at the Barracks that “Beeg Jo”
was on board the White Crest; the officer who
had been rescued and carried back to camp on
Johann’s back during the world war was now one
of the officers in charge of the American Post at
Panama. Thus one can readily understand the
result of such information.
</p>

<p>All the second day the tourists were entertained
by Bill and Bob, and were shown about
the country in touring cars which had been pressed
into service by the eager youths. Not only did
the yacht-party see everything worth seeing at
Colon and Cristobal, but they saw more of the
country round about the Atlantic side of the
Canal than most visitors do who land there.
</p>

<p>After dinner that night the entire party was escorted
to the Hop at Government Headquarters,
where dancing formed the programme of the evening’s
entertainment. The coolness of the air
made the dancing all the more enjoyable, and the
visitors declared they had never had such a pleasant
time.
</p>

<p>Before the ladies said good-night to return to
the yacht the government men had promised them
an aeroplane trip the next morning. Mr. Dalken
demurred somewhat when it was first proposed,
but his objections were soon overruled by the girls
who were thrilled at the prospect of going up in
a great army plane.
</p>

<p>Finally it was agreed that Mr. Dalken with his
two men friends should go up first and test the
safety of the plane. If he felt assured that it was
quite safe for younger persons he would consent
to their going up.
</p>

<p>The entire party made for the field where the
hangars of the two ’planes were to be seen. One
’plane was a small affair which carried but two
passengers, but the other ’plane was a large one
with a capacity for seven passengers besides the
engineer and his assistant.
</p>

<p>The air sail of about twenty minutes was
completed and Mr. Dalken landed again upon terra
firma. It was his first flight of any distance or
height, and he had enjoyed it thoroughly. He
was enthusiastic in his praise of the manner in
which the ’plane had been handled by the experienced
men.
</p>

<p>But a sudden darkness swept over the sky and
the natives were seen to scamper off for shelter,
while the officers and aeronauts hastened their
guests to the hangars until the squall of rain
should be over. It fell just as it had fallen one
day at Jamaica; it came down in torrents for a
few minutes, then the sun shone forth again in
dazzling brightness.
</p>

<p>The girls were eager to get into the aeroplane
and take their trip, but the pilot looked troubled
and shook his head.
</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Bill?” asked his companion.
</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of the sky—we’re not
through with the squall, I’m thinking.”
</p>

<p>“I think it would be heaps of fun to be above
the clouds when it rains down here,” ventured
Eleanor, coaxingly, to Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t say that if you ever went up
while a tropical squall twisted the plane this way
and that,” remarked Bob, who had heard her
speech.
</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we shall have to call it off for today,
ladies,” announced the pilot, with evident regret
in his tone.
</p>

<p>“Well, then, we shall have all the more to
look forward to to-morrow,” returned Polly,
pleasantly, but Eleanor was annoyed at the delay.
</p>

<p>“I don’t see why the nasty old weather had to
come just now and spoil all the fun!” pouted she.
</p>

<p>“As long as we do not advise taking the ladies
up to-day, why not come with us for a visit to our
sugar plantation,” suggested Bob.
</p>

<p>“What is there to see there?” pouted Eleanor,
still angry.
</p>

<p>“Well, Bill and I have staked a little cane plantation
over there and we haven’t inspected our
property for two weeks. We were so busy practicing
for the ball game, and then you came on
the scene. If you’ve never visited a sugarcane
plantation it will prove to be interesting, I’m
sure.”
</p>

<p>As nothing else had been planned to take the
place of the aeroplane trip that day, the girls accepted
the offer to inspect the small plantation.
</p>

<p>Having traveled swiftly over the rich country
where so little farming was done because of the
exhausting heat, and the prolific crops of nature-grown
fruits and herbs, the two seven-passenger
cars came to a very pretty place. Bill and Bob
who were driving, turned in to a rough road more
like a country lane, and passed acres of cane sugar.
The two young owners pointed with pride to their
property, and well they might.
</p>

<p>“The man of whom we leased this acreage said
he had a yield of from six to eight tons of sucrose
an acre every year. But he had more land than
he could cultivate, hence he leased us this acreage
and agreed to keep an eye on our men and the
work, whenever he could. The richness of the
soil and the climate gives the cane grown here an
unusual amount of saccharine to the acre,”
Bill explained, as his hearers looked over
the vast fields of cane and admired his ambitions.
</p>

<p>“Gee, Bill! I don’t know but that I’ll go in
with you boys on sugar raising. I’m sure I’d like
it down here,” said Jack Baxter. “How about it,
Ray, want to go fifty-fifty in this?”
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken laughed heartily. “If Ray knows
you as well as I do, he’ll understand that you fall
for every new project placed before you. If
some one caught you in the right mood and told
you that your fortune was to be had in digging
a Canal through South America, from the Pacific
to the Atlantic, you’d agree with them and start
in to dig. But you’d get tired of it in a week and
shirk the work.”
</p>

<p>“Why, Dalky, you slander my ideals!” declared
Jack.
</p>

<p>“Do I? What about Grizzly Slide and your
determination to take up mining out on the peaks
of the Rockies? Then in New York you went so
far as to furnish an apartment for the sake of
studying interior decorating,” said Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Dalky!” laughed Eleanor, quickly.
“He never furnished that apartment for the
study of furniture, but only for the study of
Polly.”
</p>

<p>As this temporary infatuation of Jack’s for
Polly had been one of the amusing incidents of
the past year, his friends all laughed merrily.
</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Dalken, no need to worry lest Jack
buy out a partnership share with us, because we
haven’t anything to sell. We leased the plantation
on a basis which forbids any one sinking
money in the scheme. If this year’s cane turns
out well, and we reap any profits, then we shall
feel like moneyed men—not now.”
</p>

<p>As the cars drove on to visit the large plantation
of the man who had leased the small one to
the soldier boys, the latter explained that cane
took about twelve months to mature; then after
the first cutting another crop came on; the second
crop was called ratoons. Sometimes it was possible,
weather and cane both agreeing, to cut a
third crop.
</p>

<p>From the plantations Bill and Bob drove their
guests to the big mills where the grinding was
done. The cars passed several huge stand-pipes
which were filled with water from artesian wells.
This water was carried over the plantations in
pipes and at regular intervals there was an open
flume. Into the conduit the water was emptied
daily and this form of trough carried the necessary
moisture down the rows of cane to which it
gave the stipulated quantity of water. All this
work was regulated by automatic appliances easily
handled and kept in order.
</p>

<p>Bob now explained the method of planting
cane. “They do not use seed, you know. The
stalk is cut into sections of about two feet in
length and these pieces are dropped into furrows
and covered with soil.”
</p>

<p>At the mill the visitors saw great piles of cane:
some being cut, some being stripped, and some
being piled upon great flat trucks all waiting to be
taken to the freight cars which would carry them
to the boats at Panama or at Colon.
</p>

<p>The noise made by the great machines as they
crushed, rolled, or poured the sugar from the
cane, made conversation impossible. Bill next led
his friends along beside the carrier which constantly
moved the cane through the trough to feed
the crushing machine. At the other side of this
great machine the sweet juice poured forth in
torrents.
</p>

<p>The next process was that of pumping the cold
juice into hot pans and then boiling the contents
by steam. The skimming and liming work, and
finally the feeding into the drying pans by means
of coils of pipes, proved interesting but very tiresome
because the heat of the mill was suffocating
to the Northerners. Late in the afternoon the
cars sped back to Colon and the two young planters
were induced to stay to dinner on the White
Crest.
</p>

<p>“To-morrow we will take you up in the ’planes
and have you enjoy a long ride, your last day at
our Post,” remarked Bob at dinner.
</p>

<p>“I feel perfectly safe in permitting the girls to
go after having been up and seeing for myself
how careful you boys are,” replied Mr. Dalken,
graciously.
</p>

<p>“I never thought I would enjoy a ride in the
air, as I have always felt timid about going up in
a ’plane,” said Mr. Fabian. “But I am so
thrilled by the trial that I want Mrs. Fabian to
try it.”
</p>

<p>“No, thank you, sir! I am quite satisfied with
good old Mother Earth,” laughed his wife.
</p>

<p>Thus it happened on the following day that the
two older ladies in the party preferred to stay
down, but Mrs. Courtney and the girls, together
with Jack and Ray, went forth to meet the aviators
on the plain where the government hangars
stood. They had two ’planes waiting and ready
for the sail. A large seven-passenger machine
and a smaller one which held the pilot and two
others.
</p>

<p>Into the large ’plane went Mrs. Courtney and
Nancy Fabian and Ruth Ashby, after them went
the two young men, Jack and Ray. At last the
pilot Bob and his mechanician got in. Bill with
Polly and Eleanor got in the small ’plane.
</p>

<p>As the two aeroplanes began to ascend, Mr.
Dalken called out: “Don’t go far! And don’t
remain away more than half an hour!”
</p>

<p>Those left behind stood and talked with a few
of the army men who had accompanied Bill and
Ray to the field. But after waiting for half an
hour and no signs of returning ’planes could be
seen or heard, the men said they thought Bill
and Bob had descended near Panama in order to
treat their company to afternoon tea.
</p>

<p>Soon after this Mr. Dalken heard the faint
far-off sound of a motor in the air, but no sight
of it could be seen. Finally a speck was visible
in the sky and in a short time the large ’plane
descended upon the field, but not one vestige of
the smaller one.
</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Bob, after he had assisted
the ladies to get out of his ’plane. “Aren’t the
others back yet?”
</p>

<p>“No, did you miss them?” asked Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“I don’t know which direction Bill went. We
tried to keep up with them, but that little ’plane
is a hum-dinger for speed and it soon outstripped
us. The last we saw of it was when it was speeding
over Miraflores lock—right after that it disappeared
and we saw no more of it. I flew over
the same place but it was not there.”
</p>

<p>“I hope nothing happened to them!” ventured
Mrs. Courtney anxiously.
</p>

<p>Before the group could decide upon any action,
the sky suddenly clouded over again and the rain
began to empty the rest of its water upon the section
where the most damage might be done.
Hence the aeroplane was rushed into its hangar
and the storm-stayed visitors hurried into the
empty hangar usually occupied by the small ’plane.
</p>

<p>It was almost six o’clock when the rain ceased
and permitted the tourists to return to their vessel.
Jack and Ray went to the barracks with Bob because
they were invited guests to dinner that
evening.
</p>

<p>Seven o’clock rang and darkness began to fall,
yet no word had come from the absent aviators
and every one began to worry over what might
have befallen them.
</p>

<p>“If we do not hear from them within the hour
I shall go after them. The trains will probably
run to Panama all night, and I will go there first
and start a general search,” said Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>The rain had ceased entirely now, and the night
settled down, but no word or return of the absent
girls. Then Mrs. Courtney took Mr. Dalken
aside and made a suggestion.
</p>

<p>“Suppose you accompany me to the telegraph
station at Colon? From there we will send out
wires to all the small and large stations on the line
of the Canal. We may hear from some one in
that way, and should we not get any favorable
report you can go on to Panama.”
</p>

<p>With a few words of explanation the two then
left the White Crest and made their way to the
station at Colon. Here they asked many questions
of the telegraph operator and found out that
there were many places all along the Canal where
the stranded aviators might have secured shelter
during the storm and also for the night.
</p>

<p>But Mrs. Courtney said she would feel better
if the messages were sent broadcast in order to
reach some one who would reply. Hence they began
to fill out the blanks for the man to use. Just
as they had decided what to write, the instrument
in the office began to click.
</p>

<p>“I think this wire is from your two girls; is
your name Mr. Dalken, from the yacht called the
White Crest?” asked the man.
</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! what do they say?” exclaimed Mr.
Dalken anxiously.
</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h1 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV—IN AND ABOUT PANAMA</h1>

<p>“Now what do you think of that!” exclaimed
Mr. Dalken, after reading the message he had
received from the stranded aviators who had
landed beyond the last lock of the Canal Zone.
</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney took the message and read it to
herself, then murmured: “This is disappointing:
I did so want to have the girls on board when we
went through the locks.”
</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Mr. Dalken, “we may as well
give orders to the Captain to start early in the
morning and meet the runaways at Panama—as
Polly says in her telegram.”
</p>

<p>“If only she had told us where they would stop
overnight, we could wire there and tell them to
get back here immediately. They should be able
to use the railroad, as long as they have been
able to get to a telegraph station,” said Mrs.
Courtney, a trifle annoyed at such inconsideration
on the girls’ part.
</p>

<p>“I think we will give them their way this time,
and have them miss the gorgeous trip through
the Canal. It will serve them good and right!”
declared Mr. Dalken, also impatient at such
doings.
</p>

<p>But the “girls”—meaning Polly and Eleanor—had
no cause for disappointment or impatience.
In the first place they did not see how they were
to be held accountable for the aeroplane’s engine
failing to work just about the time they reached
the vast park which borders both sides of Miraflores
Lock. In fact, they considered it an act
on the part of Providence that the ’plane had such
a wonderful stretch of lawn upon which to
descend, instead of falling down in Gatun Lake,
or upon the rocky hills to be seen everywhere
around.
</p>

<p>Because of an easy conscience, therefore, the
two girls enjoyed an unusual dinner at an interesting
old Spanish restaurant in Panama; and
then accompanied the young aviator,—who had
successfully brought his disabled ’plane to the
nearby park before mentioned,—to the Tivoli
Hotel, where a professional chaperone agreed
to look after them in order to satisfy Mrs.
Courtney’s concession to social requirements.
</p>

<p>“I think I shall have to be running along,
ladies, if I am to have that ’plane ready for work
in the morning,” declared Bill, as they reached
the hotel verandah.
</p>

<p>“And you really think it will take the yacht
from five to seven hours to make the trip
through?” asked Polly, anxiously.
</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Even if everything runs smoothly,
which it seldom does, you know, where we have
to depend upon native labor to drive the mules
and tow the boats. Better allow seven hours,
at least, I think.”
</p>

<p>“And you hope to be here for us at ten?” added
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“At ten, unless the engine goes on strike
again,” laughed Bill.
</p>

<p>“Well, then, you hurry along and forbid a
strike, while we go to bed. I’m tired with all
the day’s excitement,” said Polly, trying to stifle
a yawn.
</p>

<p>Thus unceremoniously sent about his business,
Bill laughed and lifted his cap. In another
minute he was out of sight down the old cobbled
street.
</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor found it quite unnecessary to
be rocked to sleep that night; and it seemed but
a few moments after they fell asleep before a
knock on the door of their suite roused them to
action. It proved to be a message from Bill,
left at the hotel in his passing by to have breakfast.
The message told the girls the ’plane was
in fine condition for their return trip that morning.
</p>

<p>The girls dressed hurriedly and then hastened
to the diningroom to breakfast. By nine-thirty
they were awaiting their escort who called for
them shortly after they came out upon the wide
piazza.
</p>

<p>As they passed through the ancient old city of
Panama they were interested in various sights
which Bill pointed out and about which he told
the prevalent legends.
</p>

<p>After they reached the aeroplane, now waiting
upon a stretch of sandy field near the Canal
Park, Bill assisted the girls to their places and
advised them to adjust their veils as he proposed
making a speedy flight in order to meet the yacht
before it had gone very far on its trip through
the locks.
</p>

<p>Soon, thereafter, the girls were looking down
upon a bird’s-eye view of the old Spanish town
they had just left. The ’plane followed the
course of the canal, while the aviator pointed out
Gatun Lock and the big dam, with the concrete
work built on a tremendous scale. The white
walls contrasted beautifully with the sweeps of
smooth, green, velvety turf which stretched from
the canal on both sides to the low foot hills of the
dark, blue mountains beyond. There were six
locks in all, with the canal between looking like
an ordinary stream to the girls in the aeroplane.
And the negroes, with their mules working at
the locks, appeared like busy, black ants on the
earth far below.
</p>

<p>The crew on the White Crest caught sight of
the aeroplane before Polly and Eleanor saw the
yacht; the captain saluted the fliers with a shrill
blast of the siren and attracted Bill’s attention.
After that the ’plane hovered near the vessel as it
made its way through the locks and finally came
out into the Bay of Panama.
</p>

<p>Bill landed his passengers safely, and conducted
them to the pier where the White Crest
was anchored.
</p>

<p>Of course, the girls were scolded well by Mr.
Dalken, who said he had aged twenty years because
of them and their escapades, but the laugh
which greeted this statement was not very sympathetic.
</p>

<p>Finally Bill reluctantly bid the yachting party
goodbye and returned to his ’plane in order to
reach the Atlantic side and the government offices
as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>The heat during the early part of the afternoon
was overpowering, hence one and all agreed to
remain on the yacht until the air became cooler.
But instead of riding at anchor the yacht circled
the Bay in order to find a breeze.
</p>

<p>“Bill told us that whales in the Gulf of Panama
were quite a common sight, but I forgot about
it until just now,” remarked Polly.
</p>

<p>“We’ll watch for one to-morrow when we sail
away,” said Ruth, eagerly.
</p>

<p>The sunset that evening was superb but it was
difficult to say that, in the South during that trip,
there were any clear evenings without its beautiful
sunset.
</p>

<p>Twilight swept a soft gray mantle up from the
sea and covered the shoreline from view before
the party went indoors to the saloon; then Mr.
Dalken called for the attention of his friends.
</p>

<p>“I have been studying this map carefully,”
began he, waving a memorandum which he held
in his hand; “and I find that there are very few
decent ports for us to make between here and
Quito. Even Quito must be reached by landing
first at Guayaquil and then taking the railroad inland
and climb to the City of the Equator.”
</p>

<p>“Is there any special reason for visiting Quito?”
asked Jack.
</p>

<p>“Why, of course! Don’t we all want to visit
the city so famous for its age and antiquities?
Remember, Jack, you are a mere outsider on
this trip, and not one of the seekers after wisdom
and adventure. Your day for dancing and playing
the gallant to the young ladies ended when
we bade goodbye to Palm Beach. Down in the
towns of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, it
will be my turn to lead in the Grand March,” declared
Mr. Dalken.
</p>

<p>“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dalky,” advised
Polly, sending Jack a contemptuous glance
for his interruption. “He wants to be heard
from in planning this campaign, but he really does
not know a thing about South America that he
hasn’t heard from us!”
</p>

<p>At this remark from Polly, Jack folded his
arms as if to signify he was through forever with
girls, and sat tilted back in his deck chair, but
paying no attention to anything said or done.
His associates laughed goodnaturedly at his expression,
then turned their attention to Mr. Dalken
once more.
</p>

<p>“As I was saying a long time back, we will have
to travel to Quito by means of a shaky little airline
of a railroad—I call it airline because it
evidently runs on the rim of the clouds, from all
I can gather of its construction. But it will
prove to be a novel experience for us all, especially
so to me, as I prefer to keep on solid earth
where railroads are concerned.”
</p>

<p>“As your investments prove!” retorted Jack.
“I’ve never known you to take a flier, nor heard of
you traveling in the clouds when speculating in
transportation stocks.”
</p>

<p>The laugh was now at Mr. Dalken’s expense,
as his friends well knew what large railroad interests
he held in North America, but no one was
aware of the fact that one of his secret reasons
for coming to South America was to examine the
safety of certain railroad interests offered him
through a broker who acted for the Valparaiso
and North Coast Company—a new enterprise
about to be started without delay, in order to link
the various shipping ports along the shore to the
city where the trans-Andean railroad had its terminus.
</p>

<p>“If Jack would only subside for a short time
we might be able to hear the rest of that itinerary,”
sighed Mr. Fabian. “Thus far I have
only a faint idea of the outline of the first leg
of the voyage.”
</p>

<p>“Are there two legs?” exclaimed Jack, instantly.
“Oh! where are they? I have never
seen such a leg, and it will add to my fund of
education.”
</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor laughed at the play of words,
but Nancy felt too mature to laugh at such a
childish joke. She said rather jeeringly: “Poor
Jack! ‘A fool always laughs at his own wit.’
Are you not aware that ‘leg’ is a nautical term?”
</p>

<p>Jack’s chair-legs came down hard upon the
floor, and he sat bolt upright as he showed a
livelier interest in this sparring match. “Hoh!
I may not be versed in nautical names, but at
least I am not guilty of having read the type
from every one of Dalky’s tomes on South America.
I know of certain young ladies who pride
themselves on their geography, especially when
touring South of the Equator, who lugged those
same tomes from the shelves in Dalky’s library
and now shamelessly preen their feathers of
knowledge.”
</p>

<p>“Children, if you can’t keep quiet and let
Mr. Dalken tell us of the proposed trip, you’ll
have to go to bed!” declared Mrs. Courtney,
frowning at Jack and the girls.
</p>

<p>“Or we can take our plans and go out on deck
where we need not be annoyed by infants’ prattle,”
added Mr. Fabian.
</p>

<p>“No, NO! Please don’t do that,” cried Polly,
anxiously. “We’ll make Jack keep quiet, if we
have to gag him!”
</p>

<p>“Now see that you keep your word, Poll,”
advised Mrs. Courtney, shaking a finger at the irrepressible
Jack.
</p>

<p>“Then I’ll continue,” added Mr. Dalken.
“The first port of any size shown on my map is
Buenventura, in Colombia. Since stopping at
Colon, I’ve heard so much about Colombia and
its mediaeval customs and peoples of the interior,
that I half wish we had arranged to land at
Barranquilla, which is on the coast of the Caribbean
Sea; thence we could have taken passage on
one of the wood-burning river boats that poke
along the length of the Magdalena River as far
as Bogota. From that place we would have
crossed the Andes <span class='it'>via</span> mule-train and arrived at
Buenventura to take the yacht from there on
down the coast. However, we may be able to
come back by that route—that is, providing the
females and Jack are sufficiently hardened to
mountain-life by the time we have finished the
Amazon River.”
</p>

<p>Everyone laughed at Jack’s disgusted expression
at being classed with the “females” of the
party, and Mr. Dalken hastily continued his
harangue lest his ward begin to interrupt again.
</p>

<p>“I have been advised to keep away from hotels
in the different small towns at which we might
stop to see the sights. They are miserable and
charge exorbitant rates to tourists. Also, those
ports near the Equator are insufferably hot and
with no modern accommodation, such as electric
fans, fly-screens, or other conveniences. Luckily
we have our hotel with us, and we can always secure
rooms on board the yacht, no matter what
undesirable conditions there may be for others not
so fortunate.
</p>

<p>“In order to have a glimpse of life in the small
towns of Colombia, I thought we might stop at
Buenventura, and after doing the place, we can
continue on to Guayaquil. That is the town
where we have to take the sky-line up to Quito,
commonly known as the City of the Equator.
From Guayaquil, after we return there, we will
cruise on to Paita——”
</p>

<p>“Oh, Dalky!” interrupted Polly at this moment.
“Aren’t we going to stop at any other
quaint towns along the coast? The lady-chaperone
at the Tivoli said that half the pleasure in
touring down the west coast was to be found in
seeing the unusual ports which are seldom visited
by the fast steamers. With a yacht, she said, we
were free to stop as we pleased, hence she told
us to be sure and do so.”
</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Eleanor. “And she told us that
many of the finest ruins of the Incas, as well as
ancient Spanish churches, were to be seen on the
mountains back of tiny towns on the coast that
escape the attention of the ordinary tourist.”
</p>

<p>“Well, she may be right, but as South America
is very large, and we had expected to visit as many
of its states as possible in the time limited, it would
not be advisable to do as every stranger suggests.
That is exactly why I planned this route which
would give us ample scope to turn aside in case of
our finding any place or thing we wished to visit.
Of course, the main idea in coming to South
America, instead of taking that South Sea Island
cruise as Mrs. Courtney proposed, was to give the
interior decorators the privilege of visiting the
Exposition at Rio de Janeiro. Otherwise——”
</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” interrupted Mr. Fabian.
“We know all about it, Dalky! Don’t lose time
going over the same field again.”
</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not at all keen about taking you over
the field at all,” retorted Mr. Dalken, quickly.
“In fact, I believe I’ll let each one of you follow
your own route and see where it lands you. As
for me, I shall use my private itinerary and sail
away to seas unknown—and uncharted, too, if I
see a chance of finding any reward for such a
voyage.”
</p>

<p>“I really do believe Dalky is peeved!” exclaimed
Polly, causing every one to laugh heartily
at such an absurd idea.
</p>

<p>“No, that is not the reason for his thrusting the
paper away in his pocket,” explained Mr. Ashby,
teasingly. “But the truth of the matter is: Dalky
came to that part of the itinerary where all those
twisted vowels and consonants occur in the names
of the towns in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, and he
dared not risk our jeering.”
</p>

<p>“For the first time in history, you are correct,
my wise mind-reader!” retorted Mr. Dalken,
midst the shouts of laughter from all sides.
</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose any one present would dare
wager with me, as betting is against the law at
home. But we are in South America and every
one here wagers money on horses, lotteries, and
on every possible excuse to gamble; therefore, I
would like to wager that Dalky fails to follow
more than a third of that itinerary of his.”
</p>

<p>“No one would take you up on that bet, Fabian,
because it is a sure thing!” exclaimed Mr. Ashby.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken got up from his chair and stood
gazing at his two old friends as he said: “I
never dreamed that you both would take sides
against me! But of such ungrateful stuff is the
human heart!” Heaving a dreadful sigh he
turned away and walked over to the window of
the saloon which gave him a view of the Harbor,
“Hoh!” called he, invitingly. “See whom we have
out there with us!”
</p>

<p>Instantly every one sprang up and hurried to
the windows. Through the darkness of the fast-falling
night, they could just see the large outline
of the Peruvian steamer from Panama to Valparaiso.
</p>

<p>“I wish we could get close enough to enable us
to take a picture of it,” said Polly, wistfully.
</p>

<p>“You could never do it! It’s too dark,” said
Nancy.
</p>

<p>“If Dalky had the Captain turn the searchlight
on full force we might get a good time exposure
of it,” suggested Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“At least you might try it,” agreed Mr. Dalken.
“I’ll tell the Captain to use the light when he
thinks it the proper moment. Then you girls can
experiment with your cameras.”
</p>

<p>The confusion of the crowded masses on the
decks of the Peruvian, combined with the soft-coal
and wood-burning engine which created a ceaseless
bang and clang of its steel parts, was most deafening
to human ear-drums; also the darkness which
screened the yacht prevented those on the Peruvian
from noticing the smaller craft which rode
serenely at anchor not far away.
</p>

<p>Suddenly the Captain on the White Crest saluted
with the siren as the big steamer started,
and the hoarse blast from the Peruvian as it
left its dock instantly brought all passengers to
that side of the steamer whence the yacht was
heard and seen. Many of the passengers of the
steamer had retired, but that made no difference
when such a sight as a graceful, private, oceangoing
yacht was to be seen so close by. Therefore
it was not many minutes before a triple line of
heads could be seen along the rail of the rolling
Peruvian.
</p>

<p>At an unexpected moment the Captain of the
White Crest gave the signal for the powerful
searchlight to be thrown on the big southern
steamer. And at that signal Polly and Eleanor
focussed their cameras, and began the time exposure
of the pictures.
</p>

<p>The searchlight made good on its name that
night, for with its blinding glare it not only surprised
the rows of heads craned forward in order
to see the dancing yacht, but it also brought
out those forms so scantily dressed, or rather undressed,
in their nightrobes or pajamas. A dismayed
cry rose from those thus caught unawares,
and a picture quite different from the one expected
was the result.
</p>

<p>That night, just before retiring, the girls took
one more look at the Peruvian, but it had forged
ahead out of the Bay, and away on its voyage
down the coast.
</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken had planned to leave Panama the
next day, and the Captain had been given orders
to that effect; but there were several items of
shopping which the ladies wished to do before
leaving for the South American trip, hence it
was past noon before they returned to the yacht.
</p>

<p>After leaving the yacht to do their shopping
the ladies found their way to the principal store
of Panama. As they stood outside and gazed at
the window display, a voice sounded at Polly’s
ear.
</p>

<p>“Well! I thought you all were down off Cape
Horn, by this time.”
</p>

<p>The seven heads turned on the necks of the
seven ladies to see who could be addressing them
in that familiar tone. There stood Ray who had
bid them goodbye the night before.
</p>

<p>“I suppose you are wondering what I am doing
here, instead of being interviewed by the man
who has engaged me for work down here,” remarked
Ray. “I can soon tell you: he will not
be in his office until four o’clock, so that gives me
another day off.”
</p>

<p>“Well, we certainly are glad to see you once
more,” remarked Mrs. Courtney.
</p>

<p>“Yes; now the four girls will attach themselves
to you and permit us to do the shopping for them,”
laughed Mrs. Ashby.
</p>

<p>“We can thank the custom of Panama business
men for this pleasure,” declared Polly.
</p>

<p>“We won’t lose time trying to find out who
should be thanked for this, but we will get busy
and make the most of it,” said Ray. Then, as an
after-thought, he said: “By the way, where is
Jack?”
</p>

<p>“He was afraid to come, because he knew he
would have to carry all the bundles,” laughed
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Polly, “he had to remain with
Dalky to attend to some business letters which
must be mailed before we start out on the
Pacific.”
</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness Bill had not gone back
to Colon yesterday. We might have had one
last jamboree,” remarked Ray.
</p>

<p>“Not afraid of so many pretty girls, are you?”
giggled Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Say! I can stand as many more of this kind of
girl,” declared Ray, positively. “Can’t get too
many of your kind.”
</p>

<p>“After that compliment,” said Mrs. Fabian,
“we are going to advise the girls to take care of
you this time, instead of you taking care of them.
Now, girls, if we go inside the store to do the
shopping, will you promise to be merciful to this
one lone young man?”
</p>

<p>“We will promise to take him to luncheon and
let him eat everything in sight,” agreed Nancy
with a serious face.
</p>

<p>“And we also promise to let him pay the check,”
added Eleanor.
</p>

<p>Ray now invited the older ladies to join the
party, but they said that they had no time for
pleasure that day.
</p>

<p>And Mrs. Courtney added: “Did you think we
three chaperones could be so heartless as to be
present when you take your last sad farewell of
these four sweethearts?”
</p>

<p>The young people laughed at the remark, and
then Mrs. Ashby warned them to be sure and be
back on the yacht by two o’clock.
</p>

<p>“Good gracious! two o’clock, mother? You
know how slow the service is in Panama and we
won’t have more than the silver and a napkin
served us by that time,” exclaimed Ruth.
</p>

<p>“Better make it three, at any rate,” begged
Ray.
</p>

<p>“Very well; we will return to the White Crest
when we finish our shopping and explain why you
are absent from lunch on the yacht,” promised
Mrs. Fabian.
</p>

<p>“At the same time, tell Dalky that as long as he
is saving the cost of four big lunches, he might
give us an extra hour’s time on shore,” said
Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“We’ll do the best we can for you,” said Mrs.
Courtney; “now run along and enjoy yourselves.”
</p>

<p>Ray had been escorted by Bill the previous
evening to a quaint old Spanish coffee-house in
Panama, and here he conducted the four girls in
order to give them a treat—not only a treat of
Spanish cooking but also a treat of old-time life
in that old-time city. The service was of the
simplest, but the cooking was of the finest.
</p>

<p>As the five young persons had plenty of time in
which to enjoy themselves they managed to pass
an hour and a half at the table. Then Nancy,
glancing at her wrist-watch, remarked: “It is now
two o’clock. Don’t you think we ought to be going
back to the yacht?” Thus reminded, Ray
called for the bill and the girls prepared to leave.
</p>

<p>A few blocks from the old coffee-house they saw
Jack talking anxiously to a Panama policeman.
He had a slip of paper in his hand and was
checking off certain items which were written on this
paper.
</p>

<p>“Why, look at Jack!” called Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“He looks as if something had happened,” said
Nancy.
</p>

<p>They hurried up to his side, and Ray was about
to ask him why he seemed so disturbed, when Jack
turned and caught sight of them.
</p>

<p>“Well! you’re a nice lot of friends for a fellow
to have,” complained he, impatiently.
</p>

<p>“It’s your own fault, we invited you to come
shopping with us,” declared Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Shopping, yes! but you never said a word about
a good time with Ray,” grumbled Jack. “I bet
you planned the whole thing yesterday.”
</p>

<p>“People who deceive others are always suspicious
of everything but themselves,” quoth Nancy.
</p>

<p>“Leaving all of that in the past, let’s make
the most of the present,” advised Ray. “By
the way, Jack, what’s your list of restaurants
for?”
</p>

<p>The officer, seeing that the young stranger had
found the friends he had been seeking, now walked
away. Jack held up the paper which he had
been checking and showed the girls the name
and address of every eating-place in Panama,
but not the old coffee-house where they had been
lunching.
</p>

<p>“See that list?” demanded Jack. “Well, I
raced around to every blame one of them the
moment I heard you girls had met Ray.”
</p>

<p>“How under the sun did you know we were
with Ray?” asked Polly, greatly astonished.
</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you: you girls and Ray had not turned
the corner of the street before I came dashing
around the other corner to get to the store where
you said you were all going to shop. Just inside
the door I saw Mrs. Courtney, and I was thanking
my lucky stars that I had not missed you—and
this is the result.”
</p>

<p>“Why did you want us?” asked Eleanor.
</p>

<p>“Because, Captain Blake came on deck and told
Dalky something went wrong down in the engine-room
and it might be several hours before we
could start. At that, I made up my mind to have
one more lark on shore, and I hurried away to
find you all.”
</p>

<p>“Now that you have found us, let us have the
lark,” laughed Ray.
</p>

<p>“But now it is time to go back to the yacht!”
growled Jack. “I have been wasting the two
hours hunting for you—I haven’t had a thing to
eat. Let’s go somewhere and keep ourselves
from fainting.”
</p>

<p>“We’re far from fainting,” laughed Eleanor;
“we have been feasting.”
</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” was Jack’s annoyed reply.
</p>

<p>“And what’s more,” added Polly, “we are supposed
to be on board the yacht by three.”
</p>

<p>“Yeh, I know! Dalky called after me as I left,
saying: ‘be sure and show up by three, Jack!’ and
I suppose I will have to go back with an empty
inside.” Jack’s tone was so plaintive that the
girls laughed at him.
</p>

<p>Time was passing, however, and Ray had to
meet his employer in a short time, hence he could
not accompany his friends back to the yacht.
Jack, being over-eager to get something to eat
before going back, it was finally decided to step
into the first restaurant found and order luncheon
for the famished young man. While seated at
the table with him, the girls and Ray could say
their final goodbys and be ready to depart with
Jack when he had finished eating.
</p>

<p>Upon their return to the yacht the girls discovered
that they had missed a bit of excitement
by their absence. The Captain had discovered
smoke issuing from a small store-room back of the
engine room and upon investigation it was found
that crossed electric wires had started a small fire
between the partitions. But this was soon extinguished
and quiet reigned once more.
</p>

<p>However, this necessary electric work delayed
the departure of the White Crest until late in the
afternoon, thus it was sun-down when they finally
got started on their voyage. And here we must
leave them to follow their own inclinations (and
the ways of the yacht) down the west coast.
But we shall be able to accompany them on their
tour by reading the next volume, called “Polly
in South America.”
